     \### Key points

   

   1. Chris and Tao agreed on the revisions necessary to the outline. 
      - Merging the two sections on motivating examples and potential areas for application into a single one that surveys the literature. 
        - The literature should be divided into those who explicitly build on epi models and those who we believe are relevant. 
        - Also, it can be divided into those which generate stable equilibriums, unstable equilibrium, and multi-equilibria.
      - Separate the section on incorporating heterogeneity of different kinds and the one on the consequences of these heterogeneities. 
      - Deleting the section on ABM
