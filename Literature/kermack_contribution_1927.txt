Summary.

The various possible mechanisms for the production of ammonia in a nitrogen
hydrogen mixture by means of thermions have been investigated in detail.
It is shown that synthesis can occur due to the following reactions—

Introduction.
(1)
One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty
of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the
magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every popula­
tion. I t was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the
various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present
investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross
and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is
here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which
is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows :
One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals,
more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from

the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs
through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of
those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death
vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the
affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon
the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected
members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic
is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be con­
sidered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due
to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to
an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain
whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are
left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and
mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are
still present in the unaffected population.
It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present
communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of
the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be
further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.
It will be shown in the sequel that with these reservations, the course of an
epidemic is not necessarily terminated by the exhaustion of the susceptible
members of the community. It will appear that for each particular set of
infectivity, recovery and death rates, there exists a critical or threshold density
of population. If the actual population density be equal to (or below) this
threshold value the introduction of one (or more) infected person does not give
give rise to an epidemic, whereas if the population be only slightly more dense
a small epidemic occurs. I t will appear also that the size of the epidemic
increases rapidly as the threshold density is exceeded, and in such a manner th at
the greater the population density at the beginning of the epidemic, the smaller
will it be at the end of the epidemic. In such a case the epidemic continues
to increase so long as the density of the unaffected population is greater than
the threshold density, but \tfhen this critical point is approximately reached
the epidemic begins to wane, and ultimately to die out. This point may be
reached when only a small proportion of the susceptible members of the com­
munity have been affected.
Two of the reasons commonly put forward as accounting for the ter mi nation
of an epidemic, are (1) that the susceptible individuals have all been removed,
and (2) that during the course of the epidemic the virulence of the causative

organism has gradually decreased. It would appear from the above results
that neither of these inferences can be drawn, but that the termination of an
epidemic may result from a particular relation between the population density,
and the infectivity, recovery, and death rates.
Further, if one considers two populations identical in respect of their densities,
their recovery and death rates, but differing in respect of their infectivity rates,
it will appear that epidemics in the population with the higher infectivity rate
may be great as compared with those in the population with the lower infec­
tivity rate, especially if the density of the former population is in the neighbour­
hood of the threshold value. If, then, the density of a particular population
is normally very close to its threshold density it will be comparatively free from
epidemic, but if this state is upset, either by a slight increase in population
density, or by a slight increase in the infectivity rate, a large epidemic may
break out. Such great sensitiveness of the magnitude of the epidemic with
respect to these two factors, may help to account for the apparently sporadic
occurrence of large epidemics, from very little apparent cause. Further, it
will appear th at a similar state of affairs holds with respect to diseases which
are transmitted through an intermediate host. In this case the product of the
two population densities is the determining factor, and no epidemic can occur
when the product falls below a certain threshold value.
General Theory.
(2)
We shall first consider the equations which arise when the time is divided
into a number of separate intervals, and infections are supposed to take place
only at the instant of passing from one interval to the next, and not during the
interval itself. We shall take the size of this interval, which at present may be
considered constant, as the unit of time, and we shall denote the number of
individuals in unit area at the time t who have been infected for 0 intervals by
t
vt q. The total number who are ill at this interval t is E vt e, which we shall
#= o
call
yt.It should be noted that vt Qdenotes the number of individuals at the
time t who are at the beginning of their infection. Also we shall use the symbol
Vt to denote the number who actually undergo the process of infection during
the transition from the interval t — 1, to the interval t. In general 0 = vt
except at the origin, where we assume that a certain number y 0 of the popula­
tion have just been infected, although this infection is naturally dependent on
some process outside that defined by the equations which we shall develop.
Thus

The arrows indicate the course followed by each individual until he recovers
or dies.
If tye denotes the rate of removal, that is to say it is the sum of the recovery
and death rates, then the number who are removed from each 0 group at the end
of the interval t is 'beVt, e, and this is clearly equal to vtj — v<+i>e+i.
Thus
Vt.e— 'ty_ii 0 _ i( l — — I))

= Vt-e,o^d,

(2)

where B0 is the product (1 — ^ (0 — 1)) (1 — ^ (0 — 2) ) . . . (1 — (0)).
Now vt denotes the number of persons in unit area who became infected at
t
the interval t, and this must be equal to H(f>evt,e where xt denotes the number
i

of individuals still unaffected, and cf>d is the rate of infectivity at age 0. (It is
indifferent whether we include the term <j>Qty 0 or not, since in this paper we
assume that (f>0 is zero, that is that an individual is not infective at the moment
of infection.) This follows since the chance of an infection is proportional to
the number of infected on the one hand, and to the number not yet infected
on the other.
It is clear that

We are, in fact, assuming that plague in man is a reflection of plague in rats, and that
with respect to the rat (1)/ the uninfected population was uniformly susceptible ; (2) that
all susceptible rats in the island had an equal chance of being infected ; (3) that the infectivity, recovery, and death rates were of constant value throughout the course of sickness
of each r a t ; (4) that all cases ended fatally or became immune ; and (5) that the flea
population was so large that the condition approximated to one of contact infection.
None of these assumptions are strictly fulfilled and consequently the numerical equation
can only be a very rough approximation. A close fit is not to be expected, and deductions
as to the actual values of the various constants should not be drawn. It may be said,
however, that the calculated curve, which implies that the rates did not vary during the
period of the epidemic, conforms roughly to the observed figures.

where y0 has been neglected. This is obviously no limitation as y0, the initial
number of infected cases is usually small as compared with
It is clear that
when x0, which is identical withN if y0 be neglected, is equal to 1/k, no epidemic
can take place. If, however, N slightly exceeds this value then a small epidemic
will occur, and if we write N = - -j-

In this sense the population density No — - may be considered as the threshold

density of the population for an epidemic with these characteristics. No epi­
demic can occur unless the population density exceeds this value, and if it does
exceed the threshold value then the size of the epidemic will be, to a first approxi­
mation, equal to 2
n,ht at is to twice the excess (if n is small as compared with N)
And so at the end of the epidemic the population density will be just as far below
the threshold density, as initially it was above it.
At first sight it appears peculiar that in such a homogeneous population
the epidemic should at first increase and then diminish. The reason foi this
behaviour is readily appreciated when attention is focussed on the conditions
obtaining when the epidemic is at its maximum. By equation (29) this occurs

reduced to its threshold value. Once the population is below this value, any
particular infected individual has more chance of being removed by recovery
or by death than of becoming a source of further infection, and so the epidemic

commences to decrease. In fact, as remarked above, in small epidemics the
curve for
y is symmetrical about the maximum. This symmetry exists f
as a function of t, and consequently also for dz/dt, th at is to say the curve of
removal by recovery or by death. On the other hand no such symmetry is

since y is symmetrical and x — e *

C. Magnitude of small epidemics in general case.
(11)
We have seen that in the case last discussed, th at is where the population
is limited, and the characteristic rates are constants, a threshold value exists,
such that no epidemic can arise if the density is below this value, whereas if
the density be above it, the size of the epidemic is equal to twice the excess,
provided that the excess be a small fraction of the threshold density. I t is
of importance to enquire how far a similar result is true in the general case
where the characteristic rates vary during the course of the disease.
We found that

We shall assume th a ty 0/N is small as compared with unity, and can be

I t is clear that when p is greater than zero, — log (1—
hence A p N > p
and consequently A N > 1 .
That is to say for an epidemic to occur (that is for p to be greater than zero),
N must be greater than 1/A. Writing N0 — 1/A and N — N0 -j- we have

approximately, as w/N0 may be neglected as compared with unity.
A difficulty occurs due to the fact that y0 can have no value less than unity, and so ?/„/X
cannot be made indefinitely small. I t appears, in fact, that under certain conditions quite
a number of cases might occur at the threshold value, but these would be sporadic cases and
would not constitute an epidemic in the true sense. The difficulty may be got over if we
allow the unit of area to increase. If we increase it k times then N0 increases to kN0 and A
becomes
A/ k, so that AN0 does not change. On the other hand ?/0/N0 becomes yn
and although y0 can never be less than unity, k can be made indefinitely large, and so
2/0/ kN0 may ultimately be neglected as compared with unity.

I t thus appears that precisely the same result is arrived at in this case, as in
the simpler case in which the rates were constants. There exists a threshold
population whose density is equal to 1/A, and when an epidemic occurs in a
population of slightly higher density, its size is equal approximately to twice
the excess.
It will be seen that the more complex expression A now replaces the simpler
fraction
k .1
/ In fact, when the rates are constant

Reverting to equation (20) it is clear that p can never be equal to unity, as
long as N is finite, so that an epidemic can never affect all the susceptible
members of a limited population. Of course it has to be recognised that when
the population has been reduced to small numbers the equations here given do
not strictly hold.
It may also be pointed out that the population density N0 = 1/A is only a
threshold density with respect to initial importations of cases which have just
been infected. That is to say the cases present at the commencement of the
epidemic are assumed to be of the type v0 0, and none are of the types
v0ii, iyQ>2 ... v0 r. It is this limitation which renders it impossible in the general
case to identify the threshold population with the number who are still un­
affected at the instant when the epidemic reaches its maximum, since at that
instant many cases will certainly be not just commencing but will be of the type
v0 r, and so they cannot be treated as equivalent to those which we have assumed
to have been originally introduced. Nevertheless there seems little doubt
that by analogy with the simpler case in which the rates were constants, the

point at which the epidemic reaches its maximum will, in general, correspond
approximately with the point at which the remaining unaffected population
has been reduced to the threshold value.
Another point of interest arising from equation (20) is in relation to variations
in the infectivity rate. I t will be seen th a t the effect of increasing the
infectivity from (f>0 to a
(j>eis to increase A to a A, and
threshold value N0 is reduced to N0/a.
Let a = 1 -f p, where [3 is very small, so th a t (3 is the fractional increase in
the infectivity.
The new threshold is now •
N0 — (3N0. Consequently the excess being
1+ P
now (3N0, an epidemic of the size 2(3N0 is to be expected. Thus a small increase
in the infectivity rate may cause a very marked epidemic in a population which
would otherwise be free from epidemic, provided th a t the population was
previously at its threshold value. On the other hand, if the actual density was
below the threshold, no epidemic could occur until the infectivity had been
increased to such a degree as to make the threshold value less than the actual
density.
(12)
I t is not difficult to extend these results to such diseases as malaria or
plague, in which transmission is through an intermediate host. In this case

As
p and
p' are always positive where there is an epidemic, AA'NN' must b
greater than 1, or a true epidemic can occur only when AA'NN' is greater than
unity. We thus see that there is no threshold in the sense used in the previous
paragraph for either man or the intermediate host separately, but that there
exists what may be called a threshold product 1/AA', and this must be exceeded
by the product NN' in order th at an epidemic may occur.
We shall now suppose that the value of N' = N0', and that N = —

s not very great compared with 1/AA'N0', thus N = N0 -jWe observe that if the value N had been N0, the situation would be such that
no epidemic could arise. In fact, the product NN' would have been at its
threshold value. If, however, N exceeds this value N0 by an amount n, and if
we regard N0 as remaining fixed, then under this condition N0 corresponds to a
threshold value in the former sense, and we are considering the case in which
this threshold value is exceeded by n.
Eliminating p' from the above equations we have to a first approximation

Three cases may be considered :

The size of the epidemic is here exactly equal to the excess and the result of
the epidemic is to reduce the population to its threshold value.
(3) When N0' is very great, pN 0 — 2

In this case the size of the epidemic is the same as in the simple case previously
considered. That this should be so is apparent, when we consider that the
assumption th at N0' is very great, is equivalent to the assumption that the
intermediate host is so plentiful that we are dealing with a condition which is
practically identical with contact infection.
Further reverting to equation (36) and multiplying both sides by N0N0' we
have
N0'j>No + N ^ 'N 0' = 2N0N0' (AA'NN' - 1).
We choose
N0N0' = 1/AA' = 7t0,
where 7t0 is what we have called above the threshold product. That is to say,
when the populations are simultaneously N0 and N0' there will be no epidemic.
Then
N0>N 0 + N0p'N0' = 2 (NN' - N0N0')

If the excess of population is small so th a t NN' — N0N0' is small as compared

(38)

That is to say, the difference between the values of the product of populations
before and after the epidemic is twice the excess of the product before the
epidemic over the threshold product. This equation is exactly analogous to
equation (33). Somewhat similar results have been previously obtained by
one of us (McKendrick, 1912) in an analogous but slightly different problem.
(13)
These results account in some measure for the frequency of occurrence
of epidemics in populations whose density has been increased by the importation
of unaffected individuals. They also emphasise the role played by contagious
epidemics-in the regulation of population densities. I t is quite possible that in
many regions of the world the actual density of a population may not be widely
different from the threshold density with regard to some dominant contagious
disease. Any increase above this threshold value would lead to a state of
risk, and of instability. The longer the epidemic is withheld the greater will
be the catastrophe, provided that the population continues to increase, and the
threshold density remains unchanged. Such a prolonged delay may lead to
almost complete extinction of the population. Similar results, though of a
somewhat more complicated form, hold for epidemics transmitted through an
intermediate host. In this case, in place of the threshold density we have to
consider the threshold product.
Summary.
1.
A mathematical investigation has been made of the progress of an epidemic
in a homogeneous population. I t has been assumed that complete immunity is
conferred by a single attack, and that an individual is not infective at the

moment at which he receives infection. With these reservations the problem
has been investigated in its most general aspects, and the following conclusions
have been arrived at.
2. In general a threshold density of population is found to exist, which
depends upon the infectivity, recovery and death rates peculiar to the epidemic.
No epidemic can occur if the population density is below this threshold value.
3. Small increases of the infectivity rate may lead to large epidemics ; also,
if the population density slightly exceeds its threshold value the effect of an
epidemic will be to reduce the density as far below the threshold value as initially
it was above it.
4. An epidemic, in general, comes to an end, before the susceptible population
has been exhausted.
5. Similar results are indicated for the case in which transmission is through
an intermediate host.
