%Cancer care that purports to be holistic must recognise and address
%appearance and body image issues amongst patients with cancer.
%Researchers have repeatedly tried to identify those factors that may
%indicate an increased susceptibility to body image problems since
%the results would have clear benefits in enabling care to be
%directed towards those patients deemed more at risk. The results of
%this research are largely equivocal since body image is such a
%personal concept, however some research suggests that
%appearance-related issues may, to some extent, be influenced by
%treatment, age-related ordemographic details. Cancer care that
%purports to be holistic must recognise and address appearance and
%body image issues amongst patients with cancer.
