Market Contagion: Evidence from the Panics of 1854 and 1857
By MORGAN KELLY AND CORMAC 0 GRADA*
To test a model of contagion-where individuals hear some bad news and communicate it to their acquaintances, who then pass it on, leading to a market panicrequires a knowledge of the information networks of participants, something
hitherto unavailable. For two panics in the 1850's this paper examines the behavior

of Irish depositors in a New York bank. As recent immigrants, their social network

was determined largely by their place of origin in Ireland, and where they lived in
New York. During both panics this social network turns out to be the prime

determinant of behavior. (JEL G21, N21)

The EISB was located in the greatest concentration of Irish immigrants in North America.
New York was the main port of entry into the

United States for Irish immigrants and, by the
mid-1850's, contained almost as many Irishborn people as Dublin. Like immigrants everywhere, the Irish tended to cluster in
neighborhoods of their own. In New York in

1855, Irish immigrants accounted for 28.2 percent of the city's population but made up over

During this period, well over 200 savers in the

EISB closed their accounts.
The Panic of 1857 started in New York with
news of the failure of the Ohio Life and Trust
Company (August 24) and of the loss of a
steamer en route to New York with $2 million
of uninsured gold bullion (September 17). The
crisis quickly spread from the United States to
the United Kingdom, where it provoked the
suspension of the Banking Act of 1844, and
thence to the Continent (Charles Kindleberger,
1978 p. 186). The Panic of 1857 led to a brief
but sharp rise in unemployment in New York
