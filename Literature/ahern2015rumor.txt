The business press plays a key role in capital markets as a distributor of
information (Tetlock 2010; Engelberg and Parsons 2011; Peress 2014). This
role is not passive, however, as business newspapers actively compete for
readership. To win readers’ attention, newspapers have an incentive to publish
sensational stories, namely attention-grabbing, speculative news with broad
readership appeal. Understanding this incentive is important. Media coverage
that is skewed toward speculative stories, possibly at the expense of accuracy,
could distort investors’ beliefs and impact asset prices. While prior research
shows that the incidence of media coverage influences financial markets, there
is relatively little evidence on its accuracy.
In this paper, we study accuracy in the business press in the context of
merger rumors. These stories attract a broad audience because mergers have a

The media has an incentive to publish sensational news. We study how this incentive affects
the accuracy of media coverage in the context of merger rumors. Using a novel dataset,
we find that accuracy is predicted by a journalist’s experience, specialized education, and
industry expertise. Conversely, less accurate stories use ambiguous language and feature
well-known firms with broad readership appeal. Investors do not fully account for the
predictive power of these characteristics, leading to an initial target price overreaction and
a subsequent reversal, consistent with limited attention. Overall, we provide novel evidence
on the determinants of media accuracy and its effect on asset prices. (JEL G14, G34, L82)

dramatic impact on a wide range of corporate stakeholders. For employees,
customers, and rivals, mergers lead to layoffs, discontinued products, and
increased competition, in addition to the 15–20% abnormal return realized by
target investors. At the same time, merger rumors provide a convenient setting
to study accuracy in the press because we can observe ex post whether a rumor
comes true.
To illustrate the trade-off between readership appeal and accuracy, consider
an article that appeared on the front page of the Seattle Times on September 2,
1993, entitled “Could GE Buy Boeing? It’s Speculation Now, But Not Entirely
Far-Fetched”: “A scenario by which fiercely independent Boeing succumbs to
an opportunistic corporate raider has been quietly percolating in certain corners
of Wall Street for the past year.…GE’s ambitious Chairman Jack Welch, 57,
has been taking steps to position GE to make a major acquisition.…Although
he hasn’t said so explicitly, Welch appears to covet Boeing.” A letter to the
editor that was published a few days later provides insight into how this article
was received by readers. The letter states, “In my opinion, your paper chose to
give this story front-page attention only for the purpose of selling newspapers.
Unfortunately, judging by the fact that The Times newspaper box outside the
gate where I work was empty when I left work (this is the first time I’ve noticed
this occurrence), you succeeded.”
This anecdote illustrates a number of interesting features of merger rumors.
First, the article is designed to attract readers. Because Boeing is a major
corporate presence in Seattle, a merger with GE would impact a large number of
Seattle Times readers. Second, the article is written with provocative language
that one might find in a paperback novel, such as “opportunistic raider,” “Boeing
succumbs,” and “Welch covets.” Finally, as the letter to the editor reveals,
while not everyone was convinced by the article, the sensational reporting
style was successful in selling newspapers. In the end, however, the rumor
never materialized—GE never made a bid for Boeing.
We use merger rumors to investigate two main questions. First, which
characteristics of media articles predict whether a rumor will come true?
Second, do investors account for the characteristics that predict accuracy?
While merger rumors allow us to address these questions in a relatively clean
setting, we believe the answers can shed light on the accuracy of the business
press in more general settings.
To answer these questions, we construct a novel database of merger rumors.
We manually search Factiva to identify “scoop” articles that first report a
merger rumor, whether they appeared in the online or print edition of a
newspaper. The sample includes 501 unique merger rumors in 2000–2011,
whose targets are worth 32% of the aggregate value of all acquisitions
during this period. Consistent with an incentive to win readers’ attention,
newspapers are more likely to report rumors about newsworthy targets: large,
public firms with recognizable brands and large advertising expenditures. For
instance, 88% of targets in merger rumors are publicly traded, compared

The Review of Financial Studies / v 28 n 7 2015

2052

Downloaded from http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/ at University of Michigan on June 15, 2015

to 38% of targets in actual mergers. Also, 16% of rumor targets appear on
league tables of the most valuable brands, compared to 1% for all merger
targets.
Central to this paper is the definition of accuracy. One definition of accuracy
of rumors is the literal definition. As long as a rumor is discussed in any setting,
an article is literally accurate. A more relevant definition to newspaper readers
is based on whether the merger materializes in the future, not whether someone
is making idle speculation. Therefore, we define a rumor to be accurate if
the rumor target receives an official takeover bid within one year. Using this
definition, 33% of rumors in our sample are accurate. We also provide a number
of robustness checks using alternative definitions of accuracy.
The accuracy of rumor articles has a significant impact on stock prices.
Targets of accurate rumors earn an abnormal return of 6.9% on the rumor date,
compared to 3.0% for targets of inaccurate rumors. This dichotomy implies
that returns are informative about a rumor’s accuracy. However, the average
firm realizes a significant reversal of −1.4% over the ten days following the
publication of the rumor. This finding suggests that investors overestimate the
accuracy of the average rumor.
To address our first question on the determinants of accuracy, we estimate
logit regressions of the likelihood that a rumor comes true based on four sets of
factors: the newsworthiness of the target, characteristics of journalists, details
in the text of the article, and attributes of newspapers. Because some rumors
likely circulate before they are published in a newspaper, in all of our tests we
control for stale information using the run-up in the target’s stock price before
the rumor is published.
First, we find that rumors about newsworthy targets are significantly less
likely to come true. This finding suggests that newspapers may be willing to
publish rumors that are less accurate if they feature large, well-known firms
with broad readership appeal.
Second, characteristics of journalists significantly predict the accuracy of a
rumor. Using a variety of independent sources, we hand-construct a comprehensive dataset on journalists’ education, experience, and demographics. For
example, we document that a third of the reporters in our sample majored in journalism in college and about half of the reporters are assigned to the New York
bureau of national newspapers. A journalist is more accurate if he is older, has
an undergraduate degree in journalism, and specializes in the target’s industry.
Third, details in the text of the article signal a rumor’s accuracy. Accurate
articles are more likely to mention a specific takeover price, to discuss possible
bidders, and to indicate that negotiations are in an advanced stage. Using the
dictionary from Loughran and McDonald (2011), we find that an article’s use of
weak modal words, such as “maybe,” “appears,” and “conceivable,” indicates
that a rumor is less likely to come true.
Finally, newspaper characteristics are less important for accuracy than
journalist and article characteristics. While newspaper fixed effects help to

explain accuracy, a newspaper’s age, circulation, form of ownership, and
location do not. Overall, in answer to our first question, we find that rumors
are more likely to be accurate when the target firm is less newsworthy, when
journalists are more experienced, and when the article text provides specific
details and uses explicit language.
To address our second question on the impact of accuracy on stock prices,
we provide two sets of tests. The first set of tests shows that the magnitude of
the market’s immediate response to a rumor does not fully predict a rumor’s
accuracy. In particular, traits of newsworthy firms, characteristics of the article’s
text, and journalists’age, experience, and education remain significantly related
to accuracy after controlling for the stock market’s response to the rumor. The
second set of tests shows that long-short portfolios based on the predicted
accuracy of a rumor generate significant excess returns of about 1% per month.1
Additionally, excess returns are greater when we predict a rumor’s accuracy
using variables that are harder to observe (e.g., journalists’ age and education)
compared with variables that are easier to observe (e.g., newspaper fixed
effects). This suggests that the average newspaper reader overlooks relevant,
but obscure, information.
We next show that the costs of arbitrage and the sophistication of investors
influence asset prices following rumors. First, illiquid stocks with high
idiosyncratic volatility have greater long-short portfolio returns and reverse to
pre-rumor stock prices more slowly following an inaccurate rumor. Second,
using daily data, we show that sophisticated short sellers correctly infer a
rumor’s accuracy. Finally, using daily data from a large proprietary database
of institutional trades, we show that institutions are net sellers on rumors,
suggesting that retail investors are likely net buyers.
These results are consistent with the theory that limited attention leads
investors to overlook valuable public information (Hirshleifer and Teoh 2003;
Hirshleifer, Lim, and Teoh 2011) and supporting empirical evidence (Engelberg
2008; Da, Gurun, and Warachka 2014). While this previous work has focused
on the behavior of investors, we show that limited attention has important
implications for the media. Because readers’ attention is limited, the media
competes for their attention by publishing sensational news. These news stories
skew the information environment and move asset prices.
Finally, using a hand-collected sample of official merger agreements, we
investigate the real effects of merger rumors. Of the 51% of agreements that
refer to a rumor, the most common disclosure in the agreements is that the
takeover premium is based on the target’s stock price in the period before the
rumor is published. We verify this effect in a large sample of merger bids.
The returns of rumor targets are about 8% higher during the run-up period and

1. Data and Summary Statistics
To collect merger rumors, we use a multi-step approach. First, using a wide
filter, we identify target firms named in merger rumors. After we identify the
rumor target, we search for the first article to report the rumor, or as we call it,
the “scoop” article.
More specifically, in the first step, we manually search the Factiva database
using the following filters. First, we limit our sample dates to January 1,
2000, through December 31, 2011. Second, we search within Factiva’s set
of publications called “Major news and business publications: U.S.” This set
includes the thirty-three largest domestic newspapers. Within these bounds,
we search for articles that include at least one of these words: “acquire,”
“acquisition,” “merger,” “deal,” “takeover,” “buyout,” or “bid,” and at least
one of these words or phrases: “rumor,” “rumour,” “speculation,” “said to be,”

about 8% lower at the announcement. Thus, the average acquirer fully discounts
the impact of a rumor on the target’s stock price.
Our results have several implications. First, we challenge the view that the
business press is a passive conduit of financial information. Instead, we show
that the media’s incentive to attract readers is associated with more speculative
reporting. This underscores the distinction of media articles from corporate
disclosures, which are typically more informative for large, well-known firms.
Second, our results show that while the media impacts asset prices, it also
introduces noise through speculative articles. Finally, we uncover important
cross-sectional variation in the media’s accuracy. This variation implies that
the relation between information and asset prices could vary based on who is
relaying the information to investors.
The central contribution of this paper is to provide new evidence on the
determinants of accuracy in the business press. Previous research shows
that individual investors prefer stocks with attention-grabbing news (Barber
and Odean 2008; Da, Engelberg, and Gao 2011). Our findings suggest that
newspapers might sacrifice accuracy in order to appeal to individual investors.
This provides one explanation why investors trade stocks based on narratives
in newspaper articles, despite easy access to firms’ press releases and analysts’
reports (Engelberg and Parsons 2011). Furthermore, because media speculation
is difficult to disprove, our results help explain why media articles affect even
the prices of large and widely followed stocks (Tetlock 2007). By identifying
features of the text that predict accuracy, we also extend prior research on textual
analysis in finance (Tetlock, Saar-Tsechansky, and Macskassy 2008; Loughran
and McDonald 2011, 2014; Gurun and Butler 2012). Finally, we provide new
evidence on the role of journalists in the stock market. Dougal et al. (2012) show
that the identity of the authors of a popular Wall Street Journal column helps to
predict next-day market returns. We show that accuracy varies across journalists
and identify specific characteristics that help to explain this variation.

Rumor Has It

1.1 Time-series statistics
Panel A of Table 1 presents the number of all articles, scoop articles, and public
announcements by year from 2000 to 2011. There is an overall increasing
pattern, with the year 2010 having the most articles and scoops (393 and 75)
and the years 2004, 2009, and 2011 having the fewest. There is a positive
but insignificant correlation between the number of scoop articles in a given

2055

or “talks.” This search provides a noisy sample that we further refine by reading
the articles to identify those that report merger rumors. For example, this first
sample includes articles that discuss a merger and then an unrelated rumor,
such as a rumor about a change in management. Once we identify a merger
rumor, we extract the article text, the name of the target, the alleged bidders (if
named), the media outlet, and the publication date. With very few exceptions,
each scoop article mentions just one target firm.
Next, we search for the scoop article. To find the scoop, we first trace
backward in time using the source of the rumor stated in the articles we have
identified. When a rumor is re-reported, journalists typically cite a newspaper
article that reported the story previously. In this second-pass search, we place
no restriction on the newspaper’s size or location. This means that our sample
includes foreign newspapers and small media outlets. In addition, our sample
also includes online versions and blogs of print newspapers, such as Dealbook
by the NewYork Times, which might publish rumors in advance of print versions.
We follow the citation trail until we find an article that does not cite another
media source. To verify that it is the scoop article, we search for all articles on
the target firm starting one week before this potential scoop to find any previous
articles on the rumor. In some cases, articles do not report a source. In these
cases, we search backward in time for articles about the target firm until we
find the earliest article that reports the rumor, using all sources in Factiva.
Using the scoop article date, we search for all articles that include the target’s
name in the following week to measure how widely a rumor is reported. From
this sample, we read the articles to identify those that refer to the merger rumor.
We identify separate rumors for the same target firm if a year has passed between
rumors. Finally, we search through all merger bids announced between 2000
and 2012 in the SDC global merger database to identify any rumors that were
followed by a formal public merger announcement.
The final sample includes 2,142 articles covering 501 rumors about 354
target firms. Targets include large, well-known firms, such asAmericanAirlines,
Alcoa, Sprint, and U.S. Steel, as well as foreign firms, such as InterContinental
Hotels Group, Roche Holding, and Samsung, and private firms, such as Calvin
Klein, Skype, and Groupon.
Of the 501 rumors, 167 (33.3%) were followed by a public bid for the target
within one year, whether the deal was completed or not. Though we cannot
know for sure whether a rumor is false, we can state that the majority of rumors
do not come true.

This table presents counts of rumor articles by year and month. “All articles” includes all rumor articles in the
sample. The scoop article is the first article that reports a rumor. “Percentage of scoops” is the fraction of total
scoop articles in the sample that were published in a given year or month. “Percentage of bids in SDC” is the
fraction of bids in the SDC database where the original public announcement is in a given calendar period.
“Rumors that came true” is the number of rumors with a publicly announced bid in the SDC database within one
calendar year of the original scoop article. “Percentage that came true” is the number of rumors that came true
divided by the number of scoop articles for a given time period.

year and the number of formal merger announcements in the SDC database
(0.30, p-value = 0.34). The correlation between the percentage of rumors that
emerged and the number of bids in SDC is weaker at 0.17 (p-value = 0.60).
These correlations suggest that the prevalence of rumors is not closely tied to
actual merger activity.
Panel B of Table 1 shows that articles follow a relatively uniform timing
across calendar months. In untabulated data, we find no seasonality in total
circulation for a set of prominent newspapers, consistent with uniform coverage
of merger rumors by month.2 In untabulated statistics, we find that few articles
appear on Saturday or Sunday. Wednesday and Thursday are slightly more
common than other weekdays for rumor articles, but overall, there is not much
meaningful variation by day of the week.
2 We use quarterly circulation data from the Audit Bureau of Circulations for the Wall Street Journal and the New

York Times from 2005 to 2012.

1.3 Newsworthiness characteristics
To empirically identify the newsworthiness of firms named in merger rumors,
we refer to commonly cited characteristics of newsworthiness in journalism
studies: breadth, prominence, and proximity (Eadie 2009). Breadth refers to
the size of the audience that would be interested in a specific firm, prominence
refers to how well known is a firm, and proximity refers to how close is a firm.
We use a number of variables to measure newsworthiness. First, large public
firms are more likely to interest readers because they employ more people, sell
more products, and have more diverse stockholders. As a measure of firm size,
we use log (book assets) from Compustat.As shown in panelAof Table 2, nearly
3 This is a lower bound because the estimate of our sample’s value excludes the takeover premium for public

targets and the value of private targets, though these additional valuations are included in the SDC aggregate
values.

1.2 Sample selection
One concern with our sample is that 501 rumors might seem relatively small
compared to the total number of mergers. In particular, over the period of our
sample, 2000–2011, there are 90,425 mergers in the SDC database, including
public, private, and subsidiary targets. However, most of these mergers are for
very small firms. The average bid price of this sample is $228 million, or $20.6
trillion in aggregate takeover value. In contrast, the market equity of the average
rumor target in our sample is about $16 billion, or $6.6 trillion in aggregate
market equity for 414 rumors with available data. Thus, as a lower bound, our
sample’s market equity comprises 32% of the aggregate takeover value of the
entire SDC sample.3 This suggests that our results pertain to a large part of the
universe of mergers after accounting for target size.
Second, though there are close to 100,000 mergers in SDC, it is important
to consider how many mergers receive any media coverage at all. To estimate
this, we search Factiva over the period 2000–2011 for all articles in the Wall
Street Journal, either in print or online, that include any of the words “merger,”
“takeover,” or “acquisition” in the headline. Using Factiva ticker codes, we
identify the total number of unique firms that are mentioned in any of these
articles. This is a conservative test because this sample also includes firms that
are discussed in the article but are not involved in a merger (e.g., industry rivals,
valuation comparables, etc.). We then compare these numbers to the number
of unique firms in SDC.
We find that relatively few mergers receive media coverage. Using the
algorithm described above, there are 8,402 unique firms mentioned in mergerrelated articles in the Wall Street Journal over 2000–2011. In comparison,
there are 92,570 unique firms engaged in mergers in SDC. Thus, using these
estimates, roughly 9% of mergers are covered in the media. These results show
that our sample comprises a significant fraction of both the aggregate value of
mergers and the sample of mergers that receive media coverage.

This table presents summary statistics for the main variables used throughout the paper for 501 merger rumors
over the period 2000–2011. Observations are at the scoop article level. The scoop article is the newspaper
article that first reports the merger rumor. Journalist characteristics are aggregated from individual journalist
characteristics to the scoop article level. Variable definitions are presented in the Appendix.

1.4 Journalist characteristics
To collect biographical data for the 382 journalists who authored or coauthored
any scoop article in our sample, we access a wide range of sources. We
provide a detailed description of our collection methods in section 1 of the
Internet Appendix and summarize the main data sources here.
First, we collect journalists’ birth year and gender from the Lexis Nexis
Public Records (LNPR) database. This database aggregates information on 450
million unique U.S. individuals (both alive and deceased) from sources such

2059

90% of rumor targets are publicly traded, and the average firm has book assets
worth $12 billion. Second, as evident in households’ stock portfolios (Frieder
and Subrahmanyam 2005), firms with high brand recognition are more likely
to interest a broad audience. To identify firms with recognizable brands, we
use data from the marketing consultancy firms Interbrand and BrandZ, each of
which publishes a list of the 100 most valuable brands in the world every year,
starting in 2000 and 2006, respectively. Because these lists are so selective, we
simply record a dummy variable for any target firm that appears on either list
in any year from 2000 to 2011. Roughly 16% of rumor targets have valuable
brands.
Additional measures of breadth and prominence are the ratio of a firm’s
advertising expenditures to total assets and the fraction of sales to households.
Prior research shows that advertising expenditures significantly increase a
firm’s prominence to households and lead to greater ownership breadth, more
trading, and intensified purchases by retail investors (Grullon, Kanatas, and
Weston 2004; Lou 2014). The average firm in our sample has an advertising-toassets ratio of 0.8%. To measure a firm’s fraction of total sales to households,
we use the fraction of sales by the target’s industry that are purchased by
households, according to the 1997 Input-Output tables of the Bureau of
Economic Analysis. This measure identifies firms that sell more products
directly to customers, compared to those that sell intermediate goods in the
supply chain. About 38% of rumor targets’ industry sales go to households.
Our final measures of prominence are innovativeness (R&D/assets) and growth
potential (Tobin’s q).
Proximity implies that firms located closer to readers are more newsworthy
because readers are more likely to work for such firms, buy their products,
and invest in their stocks (Huberman 2001; Ivković and Weisbenner 2005).
To record proximity, we use two measures of distance. In the first tests, in
which we compare rumored merger targets to actual targets, we record whether
a firm is domestic or foreign. In the tests of rumor targets, where we have a
newspaper article for each target firm, we calculate the great-circle distance in
miles between the headquarters of the firm and the newspaper. This measure
also helps to account for the media slant toward local firms documented in
Gurun and Butler (2012). Foreign firms account for 25% of our sample, and
the average distance between a newspaper and the firm it covers is 387 miles.

as drivers’ licenses, property tax assessment records, and utility connection
records. An older journalist could be better at assessing a rumor’s accuracy
than a younger journalist due to experience or better connections. This relation
could also be driven by selection, in which only the more accurate journalists
remain employed. Gender differences between male and female journalists may
arise if female journalists have different connections to business insiders than
male journalists.
We compute the average age across article coauthors and then use its
logarithmic transformation in regression analysis. Panel B in Table 2 shows
that the average age of journalist teams is 37 (log (age) = 3.6), and the 25th and
75th percentiles are 32 and 41 years old. For gender, we create a dummy variable
equal to one if the article has any female coauthors, an outcome observed in 45%
of rumors. In 17% of scoop articles, journalists are unnamed. Of the articles
that report journalists’ bylines, the average number of journalists per article is
1.5, with 62% of articles sole authored, 27% authored by two journalists, and
11% authored by more than two journalists.
Next, we collect data on journalists’ education. We record the university
attended by a journalist from biographical sketches on newspaper websites
and professional networking websites. To verify a journalist’s degree,
year of graduation, and academic specialization, we contact the registrars
of the universities attended by journalists or, if necessary, the National
Student Clearinghouse, a degree-verification service provider. To verify
degrees of female journalists, we use their maiden names from the LNPR
database if we are unable to verify the degree under the journalist’s current
family name.
We record two characteristics of a journalist’s education: undergraduate
major and the quality of the undergraduate institution. Reporters who received
more relevant academic training, such as that in journalism or business, could
be better equipped to assess a rumor’s accuracy and the integrity of its sources.
Also, journalists who attended higher-ranked universities may have access to
a more valuable alumni network, which can serve as an important channel of
information transfer (e.g., Cohen, Frazzini, and Malloy 2008, 2010; Engelberg,
Gao, and Parsons 2012).
We record a dummy variable equal to one if an article coauthor has
an undergraduate major in one of these six academic areas: Business &
Economics, Journalism, English, Political Science, History, and Other.4 Panel B
in Table 2 shows that the most common undergraduate major is Journalism
(33%), followed by English (31%), History (26%), Political Science (19%),
Business & Economics (10%), and Other (10%). To measure the quality of
a journalist’s undergraduate training, we use the university’s median verbal
SAT score, expressed as a percentile. Because most journalists attended liberal

Rumor Has It

2061

Downloaded from http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/ at University of Michigan on June 15, 2015

arts programs, the verbal score is arguably the more relevant score of quality
for journalists. Table 2 shows that the journalists in our sample attended
selective undergraduate programs, with a mean (median) SAT score percentile
of 83.7 (87.0).
Next, we collect journalists’ primary and secondary areas of professional
specialization from the newspapers’ biographical sketches. We conjecture that
a journalist with expertise in the industry of the rumor target may be better
positioned to evaluate a rumor’s accuracy than a journalist specializing in
another industry. In some cases, a journalist’s specialization is evident from
his or her professional job title (e.g., “Reporter, Automotive”), while in others,
it is provided by the newspaper in the journalist’s biographical sketch. We
verify the reported specialization by reading samples of the journalists’ articles.
Then, we create a dummy variable equal to one if any of the coauthors has a
primary or secondary expertise in the industry of the rumor target, using the
Fama-French 17-industry classifications. In our sample, 55% of articles are
written by teams with at least one journalist who is an expert in the target’s
industry.
Because a journalist’s location may be important for access to information,
we also record the geographic location of the journalist. Because many
of the relevant information sources of merger rumors, such as investment
bankers and stock traders, are concentrated in New York City, we create a
dummy variable to identify New York–based journalists. We first identify
a journalist’s office location from his or her job title (e.g., “Correspondent,
Atlanta Bureau”) or from the newspaper’s biographical sketch. Then we
verify these data using journalists’ residential addresses from the LNPR
Database and match them to the location of newspaper bureaus. In
49.5% of articles, at least one of the article authors is stationed in
New York.
Finally, we collect information on a journalist’s awards, which may serve as a
signal of superior skill. We consider the most prestigious journalist awards: the
Pulitzer Prize, the Gerald Loeb Award, and the Society of American Business
Editors and Writers (SABEW)Award. We collect information on award winners
from the databases maintained by the award-bestowing organizations and
record a dummy variable equal to one if any of the article’s coauthors has
been awarded or nominated for one of these awards. In our sample, 17.6% of
articles are written by teams with an award-winning journalist.
Panel A of Table 3 presents statistics on the twelve most prolific journalists
in our sample, each with at least six scoop articles. The most prolific is Dennis
Berman of the Wall Street Journal with 24 scoops, followed by Andrew Ross
Sorkin of the New York Times with 19 scoops, and Nikhil Deogun and Robert
Frank of the Wall Street Journal, each with 13 scoops. In general, more prolific
journalists are more accurate than the average journalist. In particular, Berman’s
accuracy rate is 62.5% and Sorkin’s is 42.1%, above the average journalist
accuracy rate of 37.6%.

This table presents publishing activity for journalists and media sources in the sample from 2000 to 2011. The
scoop article is the newspaper article that first reports the merger rumor. Accuracy rate is the fraction of scoop
articles in which a formal takeover bid is made for the target firm within one year. The total number of articles and
scoops for journalists exceeds the total number for media sources because some articles include multiple authors.
Abbreviations in parentheses indicate the most recent newspaper that employed a journalist. WSJ indicates Wall
Street Journal, NYT indicates New York Times, DJNS indicates Dow Jones News Service, and NY Post indicates
New York Post.

1.5 Article characteristics
Using the text of the newspaper article, we record two types of information
contained in the article: (i) the ambiguity of the language used in the article,
and (ii) details specific to merger rumors.
First, because we focus on rumor accuracy, we study the frequency of weak
modal words—a measure of an author’s confidence—based on the word list
for financial texts from Loughran and McDonald (2011), as updated in August
2013. This list includes twenty-six words, including “apparently,” “maybe,”
“perhaps,” and “suggests.” The complete word list appears in the appendix.
We predict that rumors in articles that contain a greater fraction of weak modal
words are less likely to come true. When calculating the frequency of weak
modal words, we are careful to avoid spurious matches. For example, the weak
modal word “may” could refer to the calendar month of May, the retailer May

1.6 Newspaper characteristics
Finally, we collect additional information about the newspapers that publish the
articles in our sample. We obtain circulation and founding year from company
reports and Audit Bureau of Circulation statistics. The average founding year
of newspapers in our sample is 1922. The oldest newspaper in our sample is the
Times of London, founded in 1785. The average daily circulation is 442,550
copies, and the most widely circulated newspaper is the Wall Street Journal
with a circulation of 2,092,523 in 2011. We also identify the ultimate owner of
each newspaper and record whether it is a family-run firm, which is the case
for 74% of articles in the sample.
Panel B of Table 3 presents summary statistics of the number and accuracy
of articles published by the newspapers in our sample. The Wall Street Journal
is the most prolific publisher of rumor articles, with 158 scoops, followed by
Dow Jones News Service (67 scoops) and the New York Times (38 scoops). The
5 In 3% of scoop articles, targets confirm the rumor. In Internet Appendix Table 1, we confirm that our results are

robust to dropping these rumors.

Department Stores, or journalist’s contact information (as in “the author may
be reached at …”) Section 1 of the Internet Appendix explains how we address
this issue.
Panel C of Table 2 shows that the mean frequency of weak modal words
in merger rumors is 0.8%, noticeably higher than in annual reports (0.4%) or
final IPO prospectuses (0.6%) documented in Loughran and McDonald (2011,
2013) As expected, the text of merger rumors is more speculative than that of
financial disclosures.
Second, we collect details about the article that are specific to merger rumors.
In particular, we collect the original source of the rumor cited in the article text.
The vast majority (92%) are anonymous, with the rest made up of analysts,
portfolio managers, bidder and target management, and others. We next collect
the targets’ comments in response to the rumor. In 46% of rumors, the target
declines to comment on the rumor. In 38% of rumors, there is no mention that
the newspaper attempted to contact the target for a comment. In 8% of cases,
the article states that the target could not be reached, and in 4% the target denies
the rumor.5 We also record the stage of the merger talks in seven categories
based on the text of the article. Panel C of Table 2 shows that most rumors are
in the “Speculation” stage, accounting for 51% of the sample. The remainder
is made up by “Preliminary talks” (9%), “In talks” (27%), “Preparing a bid”
(4%), “Made offer” (5%), “Evaluating bids” (2%), and “For sale” (3%). We
also record a number of additional variables that may signal the accuracy of
a rumor. In particular, we record whether the article mentions the rumor in
the headline (85%), reports the number and identity of alleged bidders (1.5 on
average), and states an alleged takeover price (39%). We also count the number
of rumor articles across all sources on the scoop date (1.7 on average).

The Review of Financial Studies / v 28 n 7 2015

rumors published in the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones News Service are
also more accurate than the average rumor, with accuracy rates of about 39%,
compared to 33% for the average rumor. In contrast, the Los Angeles Times and
NYT Blogs have accuracy rates less than 20%.

1.7 Accuracy
It is important to define accuracy in the context of merger rumors. In the literal
sense, as long as any person, anywhere, with any degree of knowledge suggests
to someone else that a firm is ripe for a takeover, a merger rumor published in
the press is accurate. However, this is an extremely low bar for accuracy. It just
implies that the journalist is not fabricating the rumor.
We define accuracy in what we believe is a more relevant way. In our setting,
a rumor is accurate if it is followed by a public announcement of a proposed
merger within one year, whether or not it results in a completed deal. This is
the measure of ultimate interest to a newspaper’s readers. The consequences
of the merger, such as the premium paid to target shareholders, the change in
control, and employee layoffs, are what the average reader cares about, not just
that someone is making idle speculation.
As in any definition, our measure of accuracy is subjective. For instance,
we could define accurate rumors as those that are followed by an official
announcement within a shorter time frame. In our sample, 27.5% of rumors
come true within six months and 15.8% come true within one month, compared
to 33% using our twelve-month window. We could also require accurate rumors
to correctly name the true bidding firm, which occurs in 15% of our sample. If
we require accurate rumors to come true within one month and also correctly
name the bidding firm, 8.4% of rumors in our sample are accurate.
We choose to use the more generous definition of accuracy based on the
twelve-month window without the requirement to correctly name a bidder.
However, in Internet Appendix Table 2, we show that our main results are
unchanged using a definition of accuracy based on a rumor coming true in
three, six, or nine months. We also show in Internet Appendix Table 3 that
rumors that are more likely to be accurate have a significantly shorter time lag
between the rumor date and the announcement of the actual merger. This helps
validate our measure of accuracy.
We acknowledge that our definition of accuracy is not without limitations.
An article could accurately report that two firms are in advanced merger
negotiations, which then ultimately fail. This would be considered an inaccurate
rumor using our definition. However, for our definition to be biased, the
likelihood of deal failure would have to be systematically related to a
characteristic of the merger negotiations or the firms involved that the journalist
does not consider. Given that newspapers select stories to publish from a vast set
of new information, it is reasonable that readers expect journalists to consider
the likelihood of deal failure when they choose to publish a rumor. We provide
empirical evidence to support this assumption in Section 7.3.

Rumor Has It

2. Which Types of Rumors Are Covered by the Business Press?

6 In this setting, we cannot compare actual distances between newspapers and firms because the firms in the actual

merger samples do not have a newspaper associated with the merger. Because most of our rumor articles are
published in U.S. newspapers, the fraction of foreign firms proxies for distance.

2065

Downloaded from http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/ at University of Michigan on June 15, 2015

We first document the characteristics of target firms in merger rumors that
attract newspaper coverage. We would ideally compare firms discussed in
published rumors to firms discussed in unpublished rumors. Because it is
difficult to observe unpublished rumors, we use actual mergers as a benchmark
for comparison. As long as the firm characteristics we document are unrelated
to the likelihood that a firm is discussed in a rumor, whether published or not,
using actual mergers as a comparison group is unbiased. To help ensure that
this is the case, we use three samples of actual mergers as comparisons: all
mergers, mergers of large public targets, and mergers of U.S. targets only. The
first subsample includes all mergers in SDC from 2000 to 2011 with a deal
value of at least $250 million. In the second subsample, we include publicly
traded targets and set the minimum size threshold of actual merger targets such
that their average value of log book assets is equivalent to that in the rumor
sample. Finally, the third subsample includes only U.S. merger targets worth
at least $250 million.
Table 4 presents univariate t-tests between average target characteristics
in our rumor sample, compared to the three different subsamples of actual
mergers. In the rumor sample, 88% of targets are publicly traded, more than
double the fraction found in the universe of SDC targets (38%) or in the sample
of U.S. targets (37%). We also find that the average value of book assets
of rumored targets is significantly larger than that of actual merger targets.
The difference between rumored targets and actual targets is even more stark
for brand value. More than 15% of rumored targets have high brand values,
compared to less than 1% for all mergers. Even in the size-matched sample,
less than 3% of actual merger targets have high brand values. Rumored targets
also spend significantly more on advertising than targets in any of the three
samples of merger targets. Similarly, rumored targets sell 38% of their output
to households, on average, significantly more than the 31% in all mergers and
34% in large mergers. Additionally, 75% of rumored targets are domestic firms,
compared to 44% in the entire SDC sample.6 We also find that rumored target
firms spend more on R&D and have higher Tobin’s q values than comparable
large public merger targets. Analogous multivariate regressions present similar
results in Internet Appendix Table 4.
These results provide consistent evidence that the financial press skews
coverage toward more newsworthy firms. Rumors are more likely to be
published for firms that appeal to a broader audience and have greater
prominence, consistent with the theoretical models of media profit motives
in Mullainathan and Shleifer (2005) and Gentzkow and Shapiro (2006).

This table presents average characteristics of target firms in the rumor sample compared with targets in actual
mergers. Targets in actual mergers are taken from SDC over the period 2000 to 2011 and exclude mergers that
are in the rumor sample. The column denoted “All mergers” includes private, public, and subsidiary mergers of
targets across the globe, where deals must be worth at least $250 million. Mergers in the column denoted “Large
public targets” include the subset of public targets where the minimum target book assets is set such that the
average firm in the subsample has the same book assets as the average firm in the rumor sample. The column
“U.S. merger targets” only includes targets in the United States, but does not constrain size or public status of
the target. The numbers in parentheses are p-values from t -tests of the average of each merger column with the
rumor column average. Significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels is indicated by ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗ .

3. How Do Merger Rumors Affect Stock Prices?
If investors can perfectly infer the likelihood that a rumor will come true,
stock returns of targets on the date the rumor is published should reflect all
information with no systematic overreaction. Instead, if investors incorrectly
believe that rumors are more accurate than they truly are, the average target
of a rumor will experience a reversal following the publication of the rumor.
To test these predictions, we calculate abnormal stock returns by subtracting
the daily return on the value-weighted CRSP index from the daily return of
the target’s stock. Cumulative abnormal returns are the time-series sum of the
abnormal returns.
Table 5 and Figure 1 present cumulative abnormal returns in event time
from 20 trading days before the rumor to 20 trading days after. On the date
of the rumor publication (Day 0), the average target in a rumor experiences a
4.3% abnormal stock return.7 Targets named in accurate rumors have abnormal
returns of 6.9% on the rumor date, compared to 3.0% for inaccurate rumors, a
highly statistically and economically significant difference. The average target
experiences a substantial run-up of about 3% over the period twenty days before
the rumor, with no significant difference in the run-up between accurate and
inaccurate rumors. In contrast, in the 20 days following the publication of the

7 We use Day 0 returns throughout the paper rather than Day −1,0 to be conservative. This ensures that the

responses reflect the rumor article rather than the run-up.

This table reports average cumulative abnormal returns in percentages. Abnormal returns are raw returns minus
the CRSP value-weighted index. Rumors that came true are those in which an official takeover announcement
was made within one year of the first report of the rumor in the press. The numbers in parentheses are p-values.
Significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels is indicated by ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗ .

rumor, targets in accurate rumors experience returns that are 492 basis points
higher than targets in inaccurate rumors. This is driven by a significant reversal
in the inaccurate rumors of −2.7%. Aggregating returns over the entire 41-day
period, target firms of inaccurate rumors realize a complete reversal, where the
total cumulative abnormal return is statistically indistinguishable from zero.
These results show that rumors in the press have large stock price effects.
They also show that the market overreacts to the average merger rumor,
suggesting that investors cannot perfectly distinguish the accuracy of merger
rumors in the press. In particular, for the average rumor, there is a significant
and large reversal of −1.4% over the ten days following the publication of the
rumor.
4. What Predicts Accuracy in Merger Rumors?
We design four tests to identify the factors that predict a rumor’s accuracy
and the factors that influence the stock price reaction to the rumor. In the first
baseline test, we run a logit regression of the likelihood that a rumor comes true
on the factors described above, controlling for year and industry fixed effects.
In the second test, we include the abnormal stock return of the target on the
day the rumor is published (Day 0 return) as an explanatory variable in the

logit test. This test identifies which explanatory factors are reflected in stock
prices and which are not. If the day zero return reflects the likelihood that a
rumor is true, then a variable that remains significantly related to the rumor’s
accuracy after controlling for the day zero return is not fully reflected in the
market reaction to the rumor.
In the third test, we refine the target’s day zero return as a control variable. In
the spirit of Bhagat et al. (2005), if we ignore the time lag between the rumor
and a public merger announcement, the day zero return has two components:
the likelihood that the rumor will come true and the expected return of the
target if the rumor does come true. Thus, the day zero return can be expressed
as r0 = p ×ra , where p is the probability that the rumor comes true, and ra is
the return of the target on the day of the public announcement of the merger.8
Rewriting this expression as p = r0 /ra isolates the component of the day zero
return related to the accuracy of the rumor from the component related to the
expected value of an accurate rumor.
To estimate p, we first estimate ra from a linear regression of target
announcement day returns on target size, industry, and year fixed effects in

8 The return r itself has two components: the probability that the deal completes and the value of the completed
a

deal. For simplicity in our estimations and because of the noise inherent in estimating compound probabilities,
we do not decompose the announcement return further.

Figure 1
Abnormal returns of accurate and inaccurate merger rumors
This figure presents the time series of cumulative abnormal returns of merger rumor targets for three time series
relative to the date of the first publication of a merger rumor. There are 414 rumors with stock price data over
2000–2011. Cumulative abnormal returns are the cumulative sum of daily abnormal returns, calculated as the
firm’s daily return minus the value-weighted CRSP index. The solid line represents the average of all target
firms. The dotted line represents the subsample of merger rumor targets where a public merger announcement
was made within one year of the rumor date. The dashed line represents the subsample of merger rumor targets
where no public merger announcement was made in the following year.

a sample of 2,555 official merger announcements of public targets over 2000
to 2011 from SDC. We use the coefficients from this model to fit estimates
of r̂a for each rumored target firm in our sample. The coefficient estimates
are presented in Internet Appendix Table 5. We discuss alternative empirical
models in Section 7.4. Using the estimate r̂a , we estimate p̂.
Following this procedure, we replace the day zero return as an explanatory
variable in the logit regression with p̂ in the third test. This logit test estimates
the likelihood that a rumor comes true, controlling for the component of the
day zero return related to the accuracy of the rumor. This means that variables
that continue to predict accuracy in this test are not fully reflected in the stock
market response to the rumor. Section 5.1 also presents an analysis of long-short
portfolio returns to assess whether investors fully account for the variables that
predict a rumor’s accuracy.
Finally, in the fourth test, we run a regression of the day zero target abnormal
returns on the same explanatory variables as in the logit tests. In addition, we
control for r̂a , the estimated official announcement return. Because we estimate
r̂a using firm size, industry, and year fixed effects, these variables are omitted
from this regression. Second, we do not control for estimated deal likelihood
in this model because it is calculated using the day zero return. While the first
three tests identify which factors predict accuracy and whether the market fully
accounts for these factors, this fourth test identifies investors’ beliefs about
which factors influence accuracy, whether or not these factors actually predict
accuracy.
In all of our tests, we also control for the staleness of the rumor. As mentioned
above, newspapers are just one link in the diffusion of information from
insiders to outsiders. Though our data collection process is designed to ensure
that our sample correctly identifies the date and original source of the rumor
among all media sources in Factiva, the rumors in our sample could circulate
in other venues first. As the theoretical models of Van Bommel (2003) and
Brunnermeier (2005) argue, informed traders have an incentive to leak inside
information in advance of official announcements. Tetlock (2011) shows that
stock returns respond less when media reports are more stale. If the staleness
of the information varies across our sample firms, we could make incorrect
inferences. For example, we could misinterpret a small stock price reaction to
a variable that significantly explains accuracy as investor inattention, when,
in fact, the price reaction is small because the information has already been
incorporated in the stock price.
To control for staleness and information leakage, we use the cumulative
abnormal returns of the target in the five trading days before the
rumor is published. If the rumor has been widely circulated before the
newspaper article is published, the pre-publication returns are expected
to be higher. Internet Appendix Table 6 presents similar results using
the cumulative abnormal returns over the twenty trading days before the
article.

This table examines the relationship between target newsworthiness and (1) the likelihood that a rumor comes
true and (2) the target stock returns on the day the rumor is first published. Columns 1–3 present fixed effect logit
regression coefficients in which the dependent variable is a dummy variable equal to one if a merger rumor came
true within one year of the first rumor date. Column 4 presents OLS regression coefficients where the dependent
variable is the rumor target’s abnormal stock return on the date the first rumor article is published. Abnormal
returns are calculated as the target returns minus the CRSP value-weighted index return. Variables are defined in
the appendix. Industry fixed effects include Fama-French 17 industry codes. Standard errors are clustered at the
industry level, and p-values are reported in parentheses. Significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels is indicated
by ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗ .

4.1 Does newsworthiness predict media accuracy?
Column 1 of Table 6 shows that the same factors that are associated with greater
readership appeal are also associated with less accurate reporting. Rumors
about large firms with valuable brands and greater advertising expenditures are
significantly less likely to come true. These results are economically substantial.
The odds ratio that a rumor comes true about a firm that does not have a valuable
brand is 1.65 times as large as the odds ratio for a firm with a valuable brand.
For a one-standard-deviation increase in target log(assets), the odds ratio that
a rumor comes true decreases by 43%.9
In Column 2 of Table 6, we add the target’s day zero returns. As expected,
the day zero returns are positively related to accuracy. However, even after
controlling for the day zero returns, the characteristics of newsworthy firms
9 The impact on the odds ratio is the multiplicative effect of exp(β ×X). A one-standard-deviation increase in

log(assets) generates exp(β ×X) = 0.564, equivalent to a 43% decrease in the odds ratio.

Rumor Has It

4.2 Do journalists predict rumor accuracy?
In Table 7, we run identical regressions as in Table 6 but use journalist
characteristics as explanatory variables.11 Column 1 shows that older journalists
are significantly more accurate than younger journalists. Second, articles
written by reporters that studied journalism in college are significantly more
accurate than articles written by journalists who studied other fields, though
the quality of the college, as proxied by SAT scores, is unrelated to accuracy.
Third, journalists that specialize in the target’s industry are more accurate.
Finally, journalists based in New York City are also more accurate.
Controlling for the target’s day zero stock returns in Column 2 or the
estimated deal likelihood in Column 3 does not affect the results. This suggests
that the market might not fully account for the predictive power of journalist
age, education, and expertise. Column 4 shows that a journalist’s age, education,
and expertise do not affect the day zero stock returns. However, rumors written
by New York–based journalists have a significantly higher stock price reaction
on the day the rumor is published.
These findings are intuitive. Older journalists with more relevant experience
may be better able to filter out false rumors, or they may have culled more
reliable information sources than younger journalists. An undergraduate degree
in journalism may equip reporters with investigative skills useful for verifying
suspicious claims. The insignificant effect of SAT scores may indicate that
these basic principles of journalism are taught equally at high and low ranked
colleges. In contrast, inexperienced or untrained journalists may be more naïve
and more easily fooled by a false rumor. Location also matters, as New York–
based journalists tend to be more accurate. This could occur because the best

regression models for all of the main regressions in the paper.

are still negatively and significantly related to rumor accuracy. In Column 3,
after including the estimated deal likelihood as a control variable, the results
persist. The coefficients for firm size, brand value, advertising, and industry
sales to households are statistically equal across the columns.10 This implies
that including the market reaction (whether the day 0 returns in Column 2 or
the estimated deal likelihood in Column 3) does not change the impact of these
variables on a rumor’s accuracy. Thus, these findings indicate that investors
do not fully account for the incentives of newspapers to publish rumors about
newsworthy firms.
Column 4 of Table 6 shows that firms with valuable brands, high Tobin’s q,
and low R&D expenditures experience lower returns on the rumor day. This
indicates that investors’ perceptions of the rumor’s accuracy are based on some
characteristics, such as Tobin’s q and R&D, that are not significant predictors
of accuracy.

business journalists end up in New York, or because New York-based journalists
have better connections to Wall Street insiders. It is reasonable that investors
might not fully account for most of the journalist characteristics, given that this
information is not prominently made available.

12 Our main results are unchanged after controlling for newspaper track records in Internet Appendix Table 9.
13 Empirical evidence in support of limited attention has been documented in the context of financial information

(Tetlock 2011; Da, Gurun, and Warachka 2014), earnings announcements (Engelberg 2008; DellaVigna and
Pollet 2009; Hirshleifer, Lim, and Teoh 2009), economic shocks (Cohen and Frazzini 2008), and investment
choices (Barber, Odean, and Zheng 2005; Solomon, Soltes, and Sosyura 2014).

last scoop, the last two scoops, the last three scoops, and all prior scoops by a
journalist. We also measure a journalist’s experience by recording a variable
that indicates a journalist’s scoop number in chronological order during our
sample period. Finally, we record the number of days from the journalist’s last
scoop. This may help identify whether a journalist actively publishes scoops
or, instead, occasionally gets a lead. In Internet Appendix Table 8, we find no
meaningful effects.12
Though we have identified the biographical traits of journalists that we
believe are the most important for predicting accuracy, other unobserved
characteristics of journalists are likely to be related to accuracy as well. In
Internet Appendix Table 10, we run journalist fixed effects regressions where
the dependent variables are accuracy and day zero returns. We include dummy
variables only for the most prolific journalists with at least four scoop articles.
Consistent with the summary statistics in Table 3, journalists Berman, Sorkin,
and Sidel have positive fixed effects on the likelihood that a rumor comes true.
For instance, the odds a rumor comes true are roughly six times higher if the
article is written by Berman, compared to all other journalists. These results
hold after controlling for the day zero return and the estimated deal likelihood.
This evidence is consistent with the theory that limited attention may lead
investors to overlook valuable public information and cause distortions in stock
prices (Hirshleifer and Teoh 2003; Hirshleifer, Lim, and Teoh 2011).13 The
marginal effects for Andrew Ross Sorkin and Dennis Berman illustrate how
limited attention is likely to drive these effects. Sorkin is a well known author
of the best-selling book Too Big to Fail, which was made into a television
movie for HBO. He is also known as the founder of the New York Times news
service on mergers called Dealbook, which uses the masthead “DealBook with
Founder Andrew Ross Sorkin.” Without controlling for the day zero return, the
magnitude of Sorkin’s fixed effect is 1.64. However, once the day zero return is
included, the fixed effect drops to 1.27, indicating that the stock returns account
for Sorkin’s accuracy, at least partially. Compare this to Dennis Berman, a
prolific journalist with high accuracy rates, but not nearly as well-known as
Sorkin. The magnitude of Berman’s fixed effect is 1.79 without controlling for
the day zero return. Once the day zero return is included, Berman’s fixed effect
remains virtually unchanged at 1.77. Rumors reported by Berman are more
accurate than the average rumor, but stock prices do not reflect this additional
accuracy.

The Review of Financial Studies / v 28 n 7 2015

4.4 Do newspapers predict rumor accuracy?
Internet Appendix Table 13 presents the results of fixed effects regressions
for newspapers on accuracy. In general, newspapers display fewer statistically
significant fixed effects than journalists. This suggests that the characteristics
of journalists are better predictors of accuracy than the identity of a newspaper.
Internet Appendix Table 14 shows that a newspaper’s age, circulation, and
ownership do not influence the accuracy of rumors. However, newspaper
characteristics do influence the stock returns on the day the rumor is published.
A rumor that appears in an older newspaper with a larger circulation generates
greater day zero stock returns than one appearing in a younger newspaper with
a lower circulation. These results are consistent with the view that the media
influences stock returns, even if it doesn’t provide new or relevant information
(Tetlock 2007, 2011).
Results in Internet Appendix Table 8 show a significant positive relationship
between day 0 returns and the newspaper’s accuracy rate in the last two and
three scoops. This provides some evidence that investors have a greater response
if an article is published by a newspaper that has recently been accurate.
These results could suggest that investors are more sensitive to newspapers’

14 We estimate identical regressions on article characteristics, in which we also include journalist fixed effects

(Internet Appendix Table 11) and newspaper fixed effects (Internet Appendix Table 12). Virtually all of the
results are unchanged. This means that even among the articles published by a particular newspaper or journalist,
the characteristics of the text predict the accuracy of a rumor.

2074

Downloaded from http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/ at University of Michigan on June 15, 2015

4.3 Does the article text predict rumor accuracy?
In Table 8, we run identical regressions as before using article characteristics as
explanatory variables. Consistent with our prediction, the first column shows
a strong negative relationship between the use of weak modal words and the
accuracy of a rumor. Next, an article that alleges that the firms are already
engaged in merger talks is more likely to be accurate than an article that is purely
speculative. An article that mentions a takeover price or lists more prospective
bidders is also more likely to be accurate.14
All of these variables remain significant after controlling for the market
response, which suggests that the language in the rumor articles is informative
of the rumor’s accuracy but overlooked by investors. This is consistent with
Tetlock, Saar-Tsechansky, and Macskassy (2008), who find that negative words
in the financial press predict lower firm earnings, but stock prices reflect this
information only after a delay.
Investors do respond to some article characteristics. For example, when a
rumor is covered by more newspapers, the rumor is more likely to be accurate,
and this accuracy is reflected in the stock price response. In contrast, targets’
day zero returns are higher when the rumor comes from an anonymous source
than when there is an identified source, yet anonymity of the rumor source is
unrelated to the likelihood that the rumor is accurate.

This table examines the relationship between article characteristics and and (1) the likelihood that a rumor comes
true and (2) the target stock returns on the day the rumor is first published. Columns 1–3 present fixed effect logit
regression coefficients in which the dependent variable is a dummy variable equal to one if a merger rumor came
true within one year of the first rumor date. Column 4 presents OLS regression coefficients where the dependent
variable is the rumor target’s abnormal stock return on the date the first rumor article is published. Abnormal
returns are calculated as the target returns minus the CRSP value-weighted index return. Variables are defined in
the appendix. Industry fixed effects include Fama-French 17 industry codes. Standard errors are clustered at the
industry level, and p-values are reported in parentheses. Significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels is indicated
by ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗ .

reputations than journalists’ reputations. This seems reasonable because it is
easier for readers to keep track of the reputation of relatively few newspapers,
compared to the large number of journalists. Alternatively, because the number
of articles per newspaper is larger than the number per journalist, the track
record measures may be more precise for newspapers than for journalists.

5. The Asset Pricing Impact of Rumors and the Limits to Arbitrage
Our results show that investors ignore pertinent information and overestimate
the accuracy of merger rumors, leading to distortions in the rumor target’s
stock price. In this section, we first quantify the economic magnitude of rumor
predictability and then consider the frictions that generate abnormal returns.
5.1 Long-short portfolio returns
We form long-short portfolios of target firms based on the predicted accuracy
of the rumor using the empirical models presented in Column 2 of Tables 6
(target newsworthiness), 7 (journalist characteristics), and 8 (article text
characteristics). We also use journalist and newspaper fixed effects to predict
accuracy. We then split the sample into firms with above-median and belowmedian fitted values of accuracy, based on each of the models. We put target
firms with above-median accuracy in the long portfolio and firms with belowmedian accuracy in the short portfolio. We include the day zero returns in the
prediction models, as shown in Column 2 of the tables. Thus, the first day that
a firm can be placed in a portfolio is the day after the rumor is published. This
makes our long-short portfolios more conservative, because we do not include
the large differences in returns for accurate versus inaccurate rumors that occur

4.5 The correlation between newsworthiness, journalists, and articles
The above results show that characteristics of target firms, journalists, and the
text of rumor articles help to predict a rumor’s accuracy. These characteristics
could be systematically related. For example, older journalists may use fewer
weak modal words and cover less newsworthy firms. While our sample
size prohibits us from including all of the numerous variables in one single
regression model, Internet Appendix Tables 15, 16, and 17 present correlations
between all of the variables.
The correlations reveal that rumors about large firms are more likely to state
that the talks are in preliminary stages and that firms with high advertising
expenses are more likely to be covered by the press in speculative articles and
to use more weak modal words. These correlations provide some evidence that
journalists attempt to indicate to their readers that rumors are more speculative
when the target is more newsworthy. We interpret this to mean that the media
follows its incentive to cover newsworthy firms even if the coverage is less
likely to be accurate, but at the same time, signals that the story is potentially
inaccurate.

This table reports monthly returns from an equally–weighted long-short portfolio, with a long position in targets
of rumors that are predicted to be more accurate than the median accuracy rate and a short position in targets
with a predicted accuracy less than the median accuracy rate. Accuracy is predicted using the logit models based
on the characteristics listed under the column named Accuracy Model, after controlling for the Day 0 return.
For each set of characteristics, the predictive model is based on column 2 of the respective table: Table 6 (target
newsworthiness), Table 7 (journalist characteristics), Table 8 (article characteristics), Internet Appendix Table 10
(journalist fixed effects), Internet Appendix Table 13 (newspaper fixed effects), and unreported tests that combine
journalist and newspaper fixed effects in one model. Firms are added to the portfolio on the day after the rumor is
published, so the Day 0 return is not included in the long-short portfolio return. Firms are held for up to one year
and the portfolio is rebalanced monthly. If less than five firms meet the criteria for the long or short portfolio,
the long-short portfolio return is assumed to be zero. The monthly returns presented here are the daily returns
compounded 20 days. Newey and West (1987) p-values are in parentheses. We follow Newey and West (1994)
to compute lags. Significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels is indicated by ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗ .

on day zero. Firms are held in the portfolio for up to one year after the rumor
date, and the portfolio is rebalanced daily using equal weights. If there are at
least five firms in each long and short portfolio, we calculate the long-short
portfolio returns. If there are fewer than five firms, we record the portfolio
return as zero. This also biases our results toward zero.
Table 9 presents the long-short portfolio returns compounded to the
monthly frequency over the period 2000 to 2012. Newey-West p-values
are reported in parentheses. Each row presents results using a different
prediction model, based on the newsworthiness of the target, the journalists’
characteristics, article characteristics, and journalist and newspaper fixed
effects.15 Internet Appendix Table 18 presents the portfolio returns for the long
and short positions separately.
If investors perfectly account for the characteristics of rumors, the longrun returns of the long-short portfolio should be zero. In Column 1, we find
positive and significant returns using newsworthiness, journalist, and article
characteristics to predict accuracy. These results suggest that the market does
not fully account for all available information. Journalist and newspaper fixed

15 These tests are not predictive regressions, and these portfolios are not an implementable trading strategy. We

form portfolios using the full sample of rumors, which means we use future information that is unavailable to
an investor. Moreover, they do not account for transaction costs, and the portfolio sizes are small. Instead, these
tests provide an in-sample measure of the economic magnitude of the distortions associated with rumor articles.

identities.
5.2 Limits to arbitrage
For excess returns to persist in long-run portfolio returns, there must be frictions
that prevent arbitrage. We investigate this claim in four settings: long-short
portfolio returns, speed of reversals for inaccurate rumors, shorting activity,
and institutional trading.

5.2.2 Reversals and the limits to arbitrage. Next, we expect that stock prices
should take longer to reverse to pre-rumor levels following the publication of an
inaccurate rumor when arbitrage is more costly. Figure 2 presents cumulative
abnormal returns surrounding the publication of an inaccurate rumor based on
idiosyncratic volatility (panel A) and Amihud Illiquidity (panel B). Cumulative
abnormal returns that are significantly greater than zero are indicated by

5.2.1 Long-short portfolio returns and limits to arbitrage. We split our
sample into above- and below-median subsamples based on two widely
used measures of the costs of arbitrage: idiosyncratic volatility and Amihud
illiquidity (Shleifer and Vishny 1997; Pontiff 2006; Amihud 2002; Hirshleifer,
Teoh, and Yu 2011). Table 9 shows that the long-short portfolio returns for
newsworthiness variables are driven by less liquid firms. Similarly, when a firm
is illiquid, the long-short portfolio returns are significantly positive when using
journalist or newspaper fixed effects to predict accuracy. However, when stocks
are liquid, there are no excess returns in the long-short portfolios. Similar results
hold for idiosyncratic risk. Though the statistical significance of these results
is modest, it is important to recognize that these are low-power, conservative
tests conducted with small samples over a year. Even in this setting, we still
find evidence that price distortions are mitigated when arbitrage is less costly.
The magnitude of the differences in returns between stocks with high
and low liquidity and idiosyncratic risk is comparable to prior work from
more general settings. In particular, in the setting of short-selling constraints,
Duan, Hu, and McLean (2010) find abnormal returns of 1.2% per month for
long-short portfolios formed on idiosyncratic risk. This suggests that costly
arbitrage helps to explain the significant long-short portfolio returns. Next,
in Internet Appendix Table 19, we show that proportional bid-ask spreads
are greater in the hard-to-arbitrage samples. In particular, liquid stocks have
spreads of about 15 basis points, compared to spreads of 34 basis points for
illiquid stocks. Stocks with low idiosyncratic volatility have spreads of 11 basis
points, compared to spreads of 37 basis points for stocks with high idiosyncratic
volatility. These results show that stocks that are more difficult to arbitrage are
more costly to trade.

This figure presents the time series relative to the date of the first publication of a merger rumor of cumulative
abnormal returns of targets in rumors that do not come true within one year of the publication of the rumor.
Cumulative abnormal returns are the cumulative sum of daily abnormal returns, calculated as the firm’s daily
return minus the value-weighted CRSP index. The squares indicate cumulative returns that are statistically
significant at the 10% level. Panel A presents abnormal returns of targets with above- or below-median

significantly different from zero, stock prices have fully reversed.
A firm with high idiosyncratic volatility takes 21 days, on average, before
its stock price fully reverses following an inaccurate rumor. A firm with low
idiosyncratic volatility takes only one day. Stock prices of illiquid firms take

for short interest has been recently used in Jain et al. (2013) and Ljungqvist and Qian (2014).

5.2.3 Short-selling activity. Short-selling activity may help to understand the
trading activity of informed investors following merger rumors. In particular,
Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang (2008) and Kelley and Tetlock (2014) present
evidence that short sellers, including retail traders, are informed. Engelberg,
Reed, and Ringgenberg (2012) show that short sellers are better able to
process publicly available information. In our setting, if short sellers are
privately informed or just better at analyzing public information, they should
be more likely to predict a rumor’s accuracy. This implies that the demand for
shorting targets of accurate rumors should fall, and the demand for shorting
targets of inaccurate rumors should increase following the publication of
a rumor.
Empirically, changes in short interest could reflect both supply and demand
shifts in short selling. To isolate changes in the demand for short selling, we need
to control for the supply of shares available for short selling. We exploit a recent
database on equity lending from Markit, a data provider that collects shortselling activity directly from security lending desks at financial institutions
(see Saffi and Sigurdsson 2011 and Engelberg, Reed, and Ringgenberg 2013
for descriptions of Markit). The advantage of the Markit database is that it
includes daily data for both the number of shares lendable (a proxy for the
supply of shares available for short selling) and the number of shares on loan (a
proxy for shorting activity).16 We obtain daily coverage for these two variables
from July 2006 (the earliest date available) through December 2011.
Using the data from Markit, we calculate the short utilization ratio: the
number of shares on loan divided by the number of shares lendable. By dividing
by shares lendable, utilization accounts for changes in the supply of shares
available for shorting. We calculate abnormal short utilization by subtracting
the average daily short utilization over the six-month period that ends twenty
days before the rumor date. To account for the delay in settlement and delivery
in short sales, we record short-selling activity for day t using the data from
Markit on day t +3, following Geczy, Musto, and Reed (2002).
Figure 3 shows that short utilization falls substantially following the
publication of accurate rumors, while utilization in inaccurate rumors stays
relatively unchanged. This suggests that short sellers close their positions in
targets of accurate rumors because they correctly predict that the shares will
increase in value. Because the decrease in short utilization does not occur
until after the rumor is published, these results are consistent with the idea
that short sellers can better process public information, as in Engelberg, Reed,
and Ringgenberg (2012). We acknowledge that the data do not show a sizable

Rumor Has It

increase in short selling for inaccurate rumors, as might be predicted. This could
reflect that verifying an accurate rumor is easier than disproving a false rumor.
For instance, even a target insider may not know if another firm is planning to
make a bid.
5.2.4 Retail versus institutional trading. Next, we present evidence on
institutional trading around rumors. Though some retail investors are informed,
it is likely that as a class, institutional investors are more sophisticated than are
retail investors.
We obtain a large proprietary database of institutional trades from 2000
to 2011 from ANcerno Ltd, a consulting firm that assists fund managers
with monitoring trading costs. ANcerno reports that all of its institutional
subscribers’ trades must be routed via an ANcerno platform and are recorded
in the database. For our purposes, the database has two advantages. First, the
database allows us to observe institutional trades at a daily frequency, thus
permitting clean identification around the release of merger rumors. Second,
during our sample period, ANcerno covers a broad sample of 969 institutions
(fund families, pension plans, and hedge fund complexes). Importantly, Puckett
and Yan (2011) show that the ANcerno data are free from survivorship and
backfill bias and are representative of the average institutional investor that
files Form 13F.
Using the ANcerno data, we first measure the change in total CRSP volume
compared to the total ANcerno volume. Compared to the daily CRSP volume
over the six-month period that ends twenty days before the rumor is published,

Figure 3
Abnormal shorting utilization by rumor accuracy in event time
This figure presents the time series relative to the date of the first publication of a merger rumor of average
abnormal shorting utilization of targets in rumors. Shorting utilization is the fraction of shares on loan divided by
shares lendable for short positions. Abnormal short utilization is daily short utilization minus the average daily
utilization over the six month period that ends twenty days before the rumor is published. Data are from Markit
from 2006 to 2011.

The Review of Financial Studies / v 28 n 7 2015

2082

Downloaded from http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/ at University of Michigan on June 15, 2015

total trading volume on CRSP increases by 136% on the day the rumor is
published. In contrast, the total trading volume of funds in the ANcerno data
(measured as the sum of buys and sells), increases by 47%, relative to the
benchmark period. These results imply that the spike in trading volume of
rumor targets is driven by non-ANcerno investors. Although we do not know
the identities of the non-ANcerno investors, it is reasonable to assume that
they are likely retail traders, because the ANcerno data is representative of
institutional investors overall.
Second, if retail investors buy shares from institutional investors after
a rumor is published, we should observe a decrease in the net buying
activity of institutions. Therefore, we construct the cumulative abnormal buysell imbalance for all institutions covered in the ANcerno database. The
buy-sell imbalance is the daily number of shares of the target purchased
by institutions minus the number of shares sold, normalized by the total
number of shares bought or sold by institutions in the ANcerno database. We
calculate the abnormal buy-sell imbalance by subtracting the average daily
buy-sell imbalance over the six-month period that ends twenty days before the
rumor date.
Panel A of Figure 4 shows that following the publication of a rumor, the
institutional investors covered in ANcerno are net sellers: starting with the
rumor, the cumulative abnormal buy-sell imbalance becomes substantially
negative over the next thirty trading days. If we separate accurate and inaccurate
rumors, the overall pattern is unchanged. Consistent with the “all that glitters”
motivation for trading presented in Barber and Odean (2008), this pattern
could reflect that individuals trade following the news story. In contrast,
the institutions in our sample are not active traders on media rumors. They
simply provide liquidity to individuals. Because individuals are often shortsell constrained, individuals tend to be net buyers, on average, and institutions
take the other side of the trade.
To better understand what drives the buy-sell imbalance of institutional
investors, we estimate changes in institutional buys and sells, relative to
total volume. In particular, we calculate ANcerno buys/CRSP volume and
ANcerno sells/CRSP volume. We calculate abnormal trading, as before, by
subtracting the average daily trading activity in the six-month period that ends
twenty days before the rumor. Panel B of Figure 4 presents the cumulative
abnormal institutional buys and sells in event time. The figure shows that
as a fraction of total CRSP volume, institutional investors in ANcerno place
substantially fewer buy orders following the rumor. Given that Puckett and
Yan (2011) show that the ANcerno funds are representative of institutions in
general, it is reasonable to assume that retail investors account for much of the
remaining increase in buy orders. These results are consistent with the idea that
target stock returns are driven by the overreaction of relatively unsophisticated
traders.

Rumor Has It

Figure 4
Daily institutional trading in event time
This figure presents the time series, relative to the date of the first publication of a merger rumor, of the cumulative
abnormal institutional buy-sell imbalance of trading in targets of rumors in panel A and institutional buys and
sells normalized by total volume in panel B. Buy-sell imbalance is the daily number of shares purchased minus
the number of shares sold by all institutional traders in the ANcerno database, normalized by the sum of buys
and sells. Abnormal buy-sell imbalance is the daily buy-sell imbalance minus the average daily imbalance over
the six-month period that ends 20 days before the rumor is published. Panel B presents the cumulative abnormal
fraction of total trades by institutions in ANcerno. The fraction of total volume is all ANcerno trades/CRSP
trading volume, where ANcerno trades are separated into buys and sells. Abnormal trading volume is normalized
as above. Data are from the period 2000–2011.

6. The Real Effects of Merger Rumors
In this section, we provide evidence on the effect of rumors on merger outcomes.
First, we collect a sample of merger agreements for deals in our sample from the

The Review of Financial Studies / v 28 n 7 2015

17 Percentages do not sum to 100% because some discussions appear in multiple sections of the agreement.

2084

Downloaded from http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/ at University of Michigan on June 15, 2015

SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.
In several cases when the merger documents are unavailable via EDGAR,
we obtain merger agreements by contacting the investor relations departments
of the acquirers. A typical merger agreement is between 150 and 300 pages
long and contains a detailed discussion of the history of merger negotiations,
the determinants of deal pricing, the opinions of financial advisors, and the
disclosure of important risks, among other details. A limitation of studying
merger agreements is that they are filed only for publicly announced deals and,
therefore, speak only to the real effects of accurate rumors. Consequently, this
approach does not allow us to evaluate the effect of rumors on the probability
of deal announcement. Because the process of obtaining and processing merger
agreements is labor intensive, we limit our sample to 95 agreements.
We search for the following keywords throughout the merger agreement:
rumor, rumour, media, article, journal, journalist, leak, leakage, times, press,
news, newspaper, speculation, speculate, and speculative. Second, we manually
read each section that contains a hit, discard spurious matches, and classify
relevant matches by the context of the discussion of the rumor and the effect
of the rumor on the takeover process. Internet Appendix Table 20 shows the
main categories of the effects of rumors and tabulates the percentage of merger
agreements that discuss each effect. Section 2 of the Internet Appendix presents
passages from the merger agreements to illustrate the language used in each
category.
First, though all 95 of the mergers were preceded by a rumor in the press,
approximately one-half of the firms (50.5%) discuss rumors in their merger
agreements. Such discussions appear most frequently in the sections that present
the narrative history of merger negotiations (68.8%), the opinion of financial
advisors (41.7%), and the recommendations of the boards of directors (25.0%).
Less frequently, media rumors are mentioned in the market value analysis
(4.2%), executive summary (4.2%), or appendixes (2.1%).17
Second, among the firms that discuss merger rumors, almost two-thirds
(62.5%) acknowledge the effect of the rumor on the market price of the target
and state that the premium paid for the target is based on the target’s price in a
period that precedes the rumor. These discussions suggest that the negotiating
parties actively discount the run-up in the target’s stock price driven by the
rumor when determining the premium. In an additional 12.5% of the cases, the
merger agreement acknowledges the effect of the rumor on the target’s stock
price, but does not explicitly state how it affects the premium. A sizable fraction
of merger agreements explicitly mention that the rumor led the involved parties
to call a meeting to discuss the rumor (20.8%) and to expedite the negotiation
process (4.2%). Finally, approximately 14.6% of agreements mention that a
rumor triggered the negotiating parties to issue a comment on the rumor.

Rumor Has It

18 Schwert (1996) extends this period for a longer duration, but the vast majority of the returns occur within the

first few days of the announcement.

2085

Downloaded from http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/ at University of Michigan on June 15, 2015

The evidence from merger agreements shows that the most frequently cited
effect of the rumor is that the negotiating parties recognize the change in the
target’s stock price attributable to the rumor and fully discount such an effect
in the determination of the takeover premium. We next verify whether this is
true for the average merger.
Schwert (1996) shows that takeover premiums include two components: the
run-up in the target’s stock price before the announcement of a merger and
the markup from the announcement to the close of the merger. If the bidder
believes the run-up simply reflects the anticipation of the upcoming merger bid,
it would revise its takeover price down accordingly. Schwert finds the opposite:
the run-up is an added cost to the bidder, and there is no trade-off between the
run-up and the markup.
To test the effect of rumors on takeover premiums, we include the full
sample of official merger bids in SDC over the period 2000–2011 for public
targets and record a dummy variable equal to one if the deal was preceded
by a merger rumor identified in our main sample. Following Schwert (1996),
we calculate the target’s cumulative abnormal stock return over the period
from 42 trading days before the public announcement of the merger until
one day before the announcement. The second period is the period from the
day of the public announcement to five days after the announcement.18 The
total premium is calculated as the target’s cumulative abnormal return from
42 days before the announcement to five days after it. We then regress the
total premium on the rumor dummy variable, plus a host of factors that might
influence target returns, including target size, industry fixed effects, and deal
characteristics.
Table 10 presents the results from these regressions. Consistent with our
prior findings, rumors increase target returns in the run-up period by about 8
percentage points, on average. This is true after accounting for variables that
could affect the accuracy of the rumor, such as brand value and size, as well as
deal characteristics, such as payment method and the use of takeover defenses.
The second set of regressions shows that rumors have a strong and statistically
significant negative effect on target returns at the announcement of about 8
percentage points. Thus the markup for rumored deals is substantially reduced.
Finally, the third set of regressions shows that rumors have no significant effect
on the total takeover premium. The marginal effect of the rumor variable is
insignificant and economically minuscule.
These results show that rumors do not contribute to the premium paid in
mergers. Consistent with the textual analysis of merger agreements, insiders
appear to correctly attribute the additional stock returns caused by the rumor
and adjust takeover prices downward accordingly.

This table presents fixed effects OLS models of the cumulative abnormal stock returns of merger targets in
the three windows: run-up (event window (−42,−1) relative to the public announcement date), announcement
(0,+5), and the combined period (−42,+5). Observations include mergers for public U.S. targets that were
announced in 2000–2011. Variables are defined in the appendix. All regressions include target size (log of market
equity). Firm-level controls include advertising/assets, industry sales to households, R&D/assets, Tobin’s q, and
a dummy for a valuable brand. The numbers in parentheses are p-values from standard errors clustered at the
Fama-French 17 industry level. Significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels is indicated by ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗ .

7. Robustness
7.1 Do bidders’ characteristics attract media coverage?
Internet Appendix Table 21 shows that bidders are also newsworthy firms. They
are large, public firms with valuable brands and high advertising expenses.
However, Internet Appendix Table 22 shows that the magnitudes of the logit
coefficients on the newsworthiness variables for targets are all statistically
greater predictors of media coverage than the corresponding coefficients
for bidders. These results suggest that target characteristics have a stronger
relationship with media coverage than do bidder characteristics.
Next, Internet Appendix Table 23 presents abnormal returns of the median
bidder surrounding the rumor publication date. In contrast to the target’s average
return of 4.3% on day 0, the average returns to bidders are −0.1%, a result that
is both statistically and economically insignificant. This implies that investors
do not react to news about the bidder, but they do react strongly to news about
the target. Thus, the media’s impact on target stock returns is much greater than
its impact on bidder stock returns.
7.2 Do extreme returns cause media coverage?
Though we argue that the media covers large, public firms, with high brand
values because such firms interest the average reader, an alternative explanation
is that journalists investigate firms that have abnormal returns or trading patterns

Rumor Has It

and mention the most extreme cases. To test this hypothesis, we regress runup returns on newsworthiness variables in Internet Appendix Table 24. If
journalists prefer to cover stocks with extreme run-ups, rather than newsworthy
stocks, we would expect to find a positive relationship between newsworthiness
and stock returns. Our empirical results do not support this view. Run-ups
are negatively related to firm size and unrelated to all other newsworthiness
characteristics except R&D. This suggests that newsworthiness is unlikely to be
confounded by extreme returns that lead to the publication of a merger rumor.

7.4 Alternative prediction models
In the Internet Appendix, we provide a wide range of alternative models to those
presented in Section 4. First, Internet Appendix Table 5 presents four different
regression models to explain target returns at the merger announcement. The
model in Column 1 is our base model and includes target industry, size, and
year fixed effects. The other columns include additional target and bidder
variables to explain returns, including return on assets (ROA), Tobin’s q,

7.3 Likelihood of withdrawals
One concern with our measure of accuracy is that rumors about merger
negotiations that do not advance to a public bid could be classified as inaccurate,
even if there were actual merger talks happening. This could confound our tests
if more newsworthy firms are also more likely to engage in negotiations that
ultimately fail. A direct test of this alternative explanation requires a sample of
all rumors, both published and unpublished, and their outcomes. Because we
cannot observe such a sample, we use a similar setting where we can identify
negotiation failures: withdrawals of public merger bids.
We select a sample of official merger announcements that are chosen to match
the characteristics of our rumor sample. Because our test relies on variation in
newsworthiness variables, we match our sample based on other variables. In
particular, we follow prior literature on the determinants of deal withdrawals
and match on year, industry, firm, and deal characteristics that are likely to
influence the likelihood of a withdrawn bid, including controls for form of
payment, tender offers, leveraged buyouts, cross-border deals, and the use of
target takeover defenses (Baker and Savaşoglu 2002; Golubov, Petmezas, and
Travlos 2012). For each rumor target, we select three non-rumored deals from
SDC using Mahalanobis distance of these matching variables to select the best
matches.
T -tests in Internet Appendix Table 25 show that there is no significant
difference between the two samples across almost all matching variables.
Internet Appendix Table 26 presents logit regressions of the likelihood of a
withdrawn bid using the matched sample. We find no relationship between
newsworthiness and the likelihood of a withdrawn bid. This provides evidence
that more newsworthy firms are not more likely to engage in negotiations that
ultimately fail.

The Review of Financial Studies / v 28 n 7 2015

7.5 Legal aspects of merger rumors
In Section 3 of the Internet Appendix, we provide a detailed discussion of the
legal environment surrounding the publication of rumors. In summary, it is
highly unlikely that a journalist or newspaper would be charged with securities
fraud for publishing a merger rumor. To prove its case, the SEC would have to
provide evidence that a journalist intentionally spread a false rumor in order to
realize a monetary gain. This is a very high hurdle, and we are not aware of any
case in which a journalist has been charged with market manipulation through
spreading false rumors.
8. Conclusion
This paper shows that media coverage of merger rumors is biased toward
newsworthy firms that appeal to a broad audience. At the same time,
rumors about more newsworthy firms are substantially less likely to come
true. However, stock returns do not reflect the reduced accuracy related to
newsworthiness.
We also provide new evidence that the biographical traits of journalists are
strong predictors of accurate reporting. Older reporters who received degrees in
journalism and specialize in the rumor target’s industry are significantly more
accurate. In addition, the specific language used in the text of a media article
helps to predict whether the rumor is accurate. For example, a discussion of a
specific takeover price, the disclosure of potential bidders, and the use of weak
modal words that indicate uncertainty provide important signals of a rumor’s

2088

leverage, capital expenditures/assets, intangibles/assets, and profitability. The
adjusted R 2 increases with more variables, but the sample size shrinks to onethird of the original sample. In general, the bidder variables remain largely
insignificant, while target q, leverage, intangibles, and profitability significantly
help to explain target returns.
Next, we construct a number of alternative estimates of p̂, the estimated
likelihood of the deal, using the new estimates of ra . Internet Appendix Table 27
presents logit regressions, identical to specification 3 of Tables 6, 7, and 8,
except that we use a variety of alternative measures of p̂ to account for the
market’s estimated deal likelihood. These include winsorizing rˆa to be nonnegative, measuring day 0 returns usingthe six-day
returns over the period −5

p̂
to day zero, log-transforming p̂ by ln 1−p̂ , and using estimates of rˆa that
include bidder industry, size, and additional firm characteristics. Across all sets
of tests, our main results remain almost identical.
In Internet Appendix Table 28, we run the same regressions as in Column 4
of Tables 6, 7, and 8, where we include alternative estimates of ra using
the three additional models of announcement returns in Columns 2–4 of
Internet Appendix Table 5. Across all specifications, our main results are
virtually unchanged.

Rumor Has It

accuracy. Nevertheless, the returns of portfolios sorted by rumor accuracy show
that investors do not fully account for important predictors of future stock
returns.
We believe our results have important implications for the role of the financial
media in the stock market that extend beyond merger rumors. In particular, our
results suggest that the media selectively provides more information about
large, public firms with wide readership appeal, but this information is likely
to be less accurate. The same bias could influence media coverage of earnings
reports, executive turnover, financial distress, or any other significant corporate
event that attracts media attention.
