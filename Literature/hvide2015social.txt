Stock market investment decisions of individuals are positively correlated with those of
coworkers. Sorting of unobservably similar individuals to the same workplaces is unlikely
to explain this pattern, as evidenced by the investment behavior of individuals who move
between plants. Purchases made under stronger coworker purchase activity are not
associated with higher returns. Moreover, social interaction appears to drive the purchase
of within-industry stocks. Overall, we find a strong influence of coworkers on investment
choices, but not an influence that improves the quality of investment decisions.

1. Introduction
Although the literature has long acknowledged the
existence of social interaction effects among individual
investors (e.g., Shiller, 1984; Shiller and Pound, 1989), most
work explaining individual investment decisions focuses

on other factors such as risk and time preferences, wealth,
or overconfidence (Campbell, 2006). One exception is
Hong, Kubik, and Stein (2004), who hypothesize that social
interaction leads to greater stock market participation and
find that those who interact with neighbors or attend
church are more likely to invest in stocks. Using extremely

detailed data from Norway, we show that social interactions with colleagues at work appear to strongly affect
individual investors' trading intensity and their stock
selection. We also analyze whether coworker influence
appears to improve the quality of investment decisions.
The social psychology literature emphasizes the
strength of face-to-face communication between individuals who frequently interact in producing and altering
beliefs.2 Conversations at the workplace occasionally center on the stock market and, we conjecture, can influence
investment behavior. For example, investors pick among a
dizzying number of individual stocks when picking stocks,
and they can obtain information from discussions with
their colleagues or make inferences based on hearing
about their choices. Conversations with colleagues about
stocks can also raise awareness of, or trust in, equity
markets and make trading more likely (Guiso and
Jappelli, 2005; Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales, 2008).3
To examine whether individual investors are affected
by their coworkers, we combine two data sources from
Norway. The matched employer–employee data, which
cover the whole population of workers over a ten year
period from 1995 to 2005, identify coworkers at the plant
level. We combine these data with a complete record of
common stock transactions made by individual investors
at the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE) over the same period. We
focus on individuals who make at least one purchase of
common stocks over the sample period.4 We omit
individual-years in which the individual is employed by a
listed company or a subsidiary of a listed company to avoid
capturing mechanic effects of company stock plans.
The results suggest strong social interaction effects. For
example, a 1 standard deviation increase in the fraction of
coworkers who make a stock purchase in a given month is
associated with a 41% increase in the probability of making
a purchase. Moreover, conditional on making a purchase, a
1 standard deviation increase in coworkers' purchase of a
particular stock is associated with a striking 194% increase
in the fraction of that month's purchases invested in that
stock by the individual.
Stock purchases could be correlated inside plants for
other reasons than social interaction (e.g., Manski, 1993).
The literature highlights correlated unobservables, endogenous group membership, and reflection as obstacles for
estimation of causal effects.5 We control for fixed effects to

2
In a classic study by Asch (1955), individuals alone and in groups
compare the lengths of line segments. The lengths are sufficiently
different that when responding alone very few wrong answers are given.
Yet when placed in a group in which all other members are instructed to
give the same wrong answers, individuals frequently give wrong
answers.
3
For suggestive evidence, Shiller (1984) cites surveys from the 1950s
and 1960s in which the answers to the questions “Do you own any
stocks?” and “Do you have any friends or colleagues who own any
stocks?” are practically identical. In a case study with a randomized trial
design, Duflo and Saez (2003) show workplace social influence in the
decision to enroll in a tax-deferred account retirement plan.
4
In a draft version of the paper, we also studied stock market
participation and obtained similar results.

These concepts can be illustrated with an example. Suppose that
purchases are correlated across individuals in the same plant. The
correlation could be due to receiving the same news (correlated

address correlated unobservables. For example, plant fixed
effects control for unobservables such as company culture,
composition of the workforce, and industry affiliation.6
Other fixed effects control for geographical differences in
investment behavior (a preference for local stocks, for
example) and for individuals following simple decision
rules such as picking stocks based on their recent performance record. On top of this, we control for sociodemographic variables at the individual-year level.
Workers with similar unobserved characteristics, such
as risk preferences, access to information, or investment
style, could self-select to plants in a pattern not captured
by the controls. To address such endogenous group membership, we analyze the investment behavior of individuals
who move between plants. The idea is that future coworkers are unlikely to influence via social interaction but
can still exhibit correlated behavior due to similarity along
unobservables. Thus, if unobserved similarities drive the
results, we would expect the correlation with future coworkers to be of comparable magnitude to the correlation
with current coworkers.
In Fig. 1, time is on the horizontal axis and the
correlation in purchasing behavior is on the vertical axis.
Month 0 is the starting month in the new job and end
month in the old job. The blue dashed line illustrates how
the correlation in purchasing behavior with individuals
who become coworkers after the move evolves over time.
Up to three months before the move, the correlation in
purchasing activity with these future peers is close to zero.
Thus, endogenous group membership seems to be of
minor concern. The red solid line illustrates how the
correlation with individuals who are coworkers prior to
the move evolves over time. Prior to Month 0, the
correlation is significantly higher than the correlation with
future coworkers and then fades out after the move.
Our results could be driven by events at the plantmonth level, such as visits from equity brokers. If so, we
would expect a similar correlation in trading behavior
between pairs of individuals at small and large plants. If
social interaction drives our results, in contrast, we would
expect stronger correlation between individuals at small
plants than at large plants, simply because two individuals
are more likely to engage at a small plant. For each month,
we rank all plants into ten size deciles, based on number of
employees. We then sample two individuals from each
plant-month and estimate the within-plant correlation in
purchasing activity across size deciles. In support of the

unobservables), because they have similar investment style (endogenous
group membership) or because of social interaction. Under social interaction, the group affects the individual and the individual affects the
group, in which case it is not straightforward to back out the structural
parameters of social influence from the estimated correlations. This is the
reflection problem of Manski (1993), referred to as the simultaneity
problem in Moffitt (2001).
6
These are contextual and ecological effects in the terminology of
Manski (1993), which should be contrasted with the endogenous social
effects. Lee (2007) and Lee, Liu, and Lin (2010) analyze how fixed effects
alleviate the problem of correlated unobservables in the identification of
endogenous social effects. Blume, Brock, Durlauf, and Ioannides (2010)
survey the literature.

Fig. 1. This figure plots the peer interaction coefficient, which is the
increase in the likelihood that an individual makes a purchase if all of his
coworkers make a purchase in that month. We consider the effect of old
coworkers and new coworkers from 12 months before the individual
leaves the old plant to 12 months after the individual joins the new plant.
0 is the start date of the new job and end date of the old job. See Section
3.2 for estimation details.

social interaction mechanism, we find that the estimated
correlation is considerably larger for small plants than for
large plants.
Does social interaction improve the quality of investment decisions? The logic behind information cascade
models (Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch, 1992;
Banerjee, 1992; Ellison and Fudenberg, 1993) suggests that
imitating coworkers can make investment decisions more
enlightened through diffusion of return-relevant information or, perhaps, through learning sound investment
principles such as diversification and hedging. Alternatively, information transmitted at the workplace could be
false rumors, or it could involve imitation of unsound
practices such as technical analysis (March, 1991).7 The
welfare implications are substantially different.
We address whether social interaction improves investment quality in two ways. First, using the calendar time
portfolio approach (e.g., Odean, 1999; Seasholes and Zhu,
2010), we analyze whether risk-adjusted investment
returns are higher when coworkers purchase a particular
stock more intensely. We find that purchases made under
strong purchase pressure do not outperform purchases
made under weak purchase pressure. Hence, the social
interaction effects we find do not seem rooted in diffusion
of value-relevant asymmetric information. Second, an
investment mistake that has been abundantly recorded is
the tendency to hedge poorly against fluctuations in future
labor income by holding own-company or own-industry
stocks. As a stark example, employees of Pfizer, Inc., invest
7
An anecdote relayed by Benartzi and Thaler (2007, p. 94) in the
context of 401(k) pension plan choices by employees in a supermarket
chain in Texas provides a nice illustration of this point: “The plan
provider noticed that participants' behavior in each supermarket was
remarkably homogeneous, but the behavior across supermarkets was
fairly heterogeneous. It turns out that most of the supermarket employees considered the store butcher to be the investment maven and would
turn to him for advice. Depending on the investment philosophy of the
butcher at each individual location, employees ended up being heavily
invested in stocks or heavily invested in bonds.”

almost 90% of the value of their defined contribution plan
in Pfizer common stock (see Cohen, 2008). We analyze
whether the impact of coworkers is larger for the purchase
of within-industry stocks than for other stocks, and we
find strong affirmative evidence. Moreover, withinindustry stock purchases made under stronger peer pressure are not associated with significantly higher investment returns. Taken together, these results suggest that
social interaction, instead of improving investor welfare,
could propagate investment mistakes.
Overall, the findings suggest that individuals are
strongly influenced by their coworkers, but this influence
does not improve, and sometimes reduces, the quality of
their investment choices. At the normative level, we offer
advice to individual investors themselves: Listening to
coworkers is unlikely to improve the quality of
investments.
The paper connects to several ongoing debates. First,
much of the existing work on social interaction among
individual investors (Hong, Kubik, and Stein, 2004; Ivković
and Weisbenner, 2007; Brown, Ivković, Smith, and
Weisbenner, 2008; Kaustia and Knüpfer, 2012) is based
on analysis of large groups, such as regions or neighborhoods, in which identification of social effects is difficult
(e.g., Moffitt, 2001).8 We construct peer groups at a much
more local level, the workplace, and find evidence of
strong social interaction effects even after accounting for
correlated unobservables, endogenous group membership,
and reflection. Our evidence contrasts with Feng and
Seasholes (2004), who in a small-group environment
(trading rooms in China) do not find evidence of social
interaction effects. It also contrasts with Beshears, Choi,
Laibson, Madrian, and Milkman (2011), who find negative
coworker peer effects (boomerang effects) in the adoption
of a simplified 401(k) plan.
Second, we provide empirical evidence on whether
information obtained through social interaction is useful
or not. The theoretical literature on information cascades
(Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch, 1992; Banerjee,
1992; Ellison and Fudenberg, 1993) posits that information
cascades in social groups are (at least on average) rooted in
value-relevant information. We fail to find affirmative
evidence for this hypothesis. The insights transmitted
through social interaction between coworkers seem to be
noise at best. Our results stand in contrast to the economics literature, which emphasizes positive spillover effects
[e.g., Mas and Moretti (2009) on productivity spillover
effects for workers].
Third, we contribute to the debate on what explains
investment mistakes. A large empirical literature has
shown that individual investors tend to make systematic
investment mistakes [see, e.g., Odean (1999) or Benartzi
and Thaler (2007) and Campbell (2006) for overviews].
While the extant literature attempts to explain these

8
The same point can be made about much of the literature on social
interaction in economics (e.g., Bertrand, Luttmer, and Mullainathan,
2000; Moretti, 2011). Whilst our focus is on social interaction in a
naturally occurring group, a related literature considers social interaction
effects under randomized group formation (e.g., Bursztyn, Ederer,
Ferman, and Yuchtman, 2013; Dahl, Løken, and Mogstad, 2012).

H.K. Hvide, P. Östberg / Journal of Financial Economics 117 (2015) 628–652

mistakes with individual characteristics such as gender,
wealth, income, genetics, or intelligence quotient (IQ) (e.g.,
Campbell, 2006; Cohen, 2008; Cronqvist and Siegel, 2013),
we demonstrate the role of social interaction. Our findings
have an interesting parallel in the medical literature.
Christakis and Fowler (2007) provide evidence consistent
with obesity in the US spreading through social
interaction.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents the data. Section 3 has results on the
timing of purchases, and Section 4 has on stock selection.
Section 5 analyzes whether purchases that are highly
correlated with those of coworkers are associated with
abnormal returns. Section 6 concludes.

2. Data
The data set is proprietary and has been collected from
three sources. First, a record of all common stock trades
made between January 1994 and December 2005 by
Norwegian residents on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE)
come from Verdipapirsentralen (the Norwegian Central
Securities Depository). For each transaction made by an
individual, the data contain the (anonymized) identification (ID) of the individual, the transaction date, the ticker
of the security, and the number of shares bought or sold.
To preserve anonymity, the trade records of the 20 most
active investors are not contained in the data. Second,
company information such as ticker, prices, market capitalization, and company ID numbers come from the OSE.
When needed, additional information is collected from
Borsprosjektet (the OSE project) at the Norwegian School
of Economics. Third, the government statistical agency,
Statistics Norway, provided register data on the sociodemographic characteristics of investors. The data come
from government registries assembled for tax-collection
purposes and are highly reliable.9
For each individual-year, the data include the ID of the
plant at which the individual is employed (the plant ID
stays fixed through ownership changes), the IDs of the
individual's spouse and children, and the zip code in which
the individual lives. If two individuals work at the same
plant, it means that they share the same business address.
We also identify other family members: parents, grandparents, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, cousins,
nieces and nephews. The socioeconomic variables are
income and wealth, age, gender, education, and employer
variables such as industry (five-digit NACE code) and an
unique employer ID number.10 For individuals that change
firms during the sample period, the Statistics Norway data
contain the end date of employment at the old firm and
the start date of employment at the new firm. Huttunen,

The data are described in more detail in Døskeland and Hvide
(2011), which also discusses the Norwegian institutional environment,
including questions about representativity and the Norwegian pension
system.

classification system equivalent to the standard industrial classification
(SIC) system in the US.

Møen, and Salvanes (2011) contains a further description
of the job start and job end variables.
2.1. Sample selection
The starting point for the sample selection is individuals who are employed full time for at least one year
between 1994 and 2005 and who purchase common
stocks on the Oslo Stock Exchange at least once during
the same period (about 12% of the population). We omit
individual-years in which the individual is employed part
time or is employed by a listed company or a subsidiary of
a listed company. This exclusion is done to ensure that
employee stock ownership plans, which would imply a
near-mechanic correlation in purchasing behavior at the
plant level, are not driving the results [in Norway, purchases up to Norwegian Kroner (NOK) 1500 in owncompany stock are subject to a tax break]. We also exclude
individual-years of employment in financial services
(NACE codes 65, 66, and 67) as a simple way to eliminate
professional investors from the sample (the results are
slightly stronger if we keep these industries). We are left
with a sample of about 170,000 individuals. The coworker
peer group of the individuals is defined somewhat more
broadly. We include part-time employees (and, for family
and zip code peer groups, individuals employed in the
financial sector). The family peer group contains the
spouse, children, parents, grandparents, grandchildren,
siblings, uncles, aunts, cousins, nieces, and nephews of
the individual. The geographic peer group contains all
those who live in the same zip code as the individual. We
refer to an individual in the sample or in one of the peer
groups who makes at least one purchase of stock during
the period 1994 to 2005 as an investor.
For the purchase decision analysis of Section 3, we keep
individuals who have (a) at least one coworker who is an
investor (i.e., purchases stocks at least once between 1994
and 2005), (b) at least one person in the same zip code
who is an investor, and (c) at least one family member who
is an investor. The purchasing activity of coworkers is our
main explanatory variable, and we impose (b) and (c) to
control for the purchasing activity of zip code and family
members (these controls would not be defined otherwise).
We also require that the socio-demographic variables are
non-missing (this requirement affects only a small fraction
of observations). This leaves 97,264 unique individuals
over the entire period. In Panel A of Table A2 we provide
socio-demographic descriptive statistics of the sample
individuals (a random year for each individual has been
selected). In the year 2000, the sample individuals are
spread over about 26 hundred zip codes and roughly 18
thousand plants.
The stock selection analysis of Section 4 conditions on a
purchase having been made (by definition) and, therefore,
implies different sample selection criteria. For an
individual-month to be included in the sample, we require
that the individual, at least one coworker, and one person
in the zip code make a purchase in that month. Panel C of
Table A2 provides descriptive statistics of the 118,432
unique individuals present in the stock selection analysis.
The socio-demographic characteristics of this sample are

632

H.K. Hvide, P. Östberg / Journal of Financial Economics 117 (2015) 628–652

similar to the purchase decision sample (covered in
Section 3). The sample is somewhat larger than in
Section 3 because we exclude the family peer group.
Restricting the analysis to individuals who have family
members purchasing stocks in the same month would
leave only 28 hundred unique individuals. In unreported
regressions, we verify that the results are very similar for
this subsample, even after controlling for the stock selection of family members.
In Section 3.2 and Section 4.2, we consider individuals
who move between plants. For a move to be included in
the analysis, we require that the termination date of the
old job and the start date of the new job are both nonmissing from the data. This implies that individuals who
start a job fresh from school or move from abroad are
excluded. We lose about half of the moves in the database
due to this restriction. We require that, at the time of the
move, the individual did not change plants in the preceding year or in the following year (to focus on jobs that are
not of a temporary nature).11 We focus on stock market
activity during the 12 months prior to leaving the old plant
and 12 months after moving to the new plant, which
means that we consider moves that occur between January
1995 and December 2004. These criteria leave 14,284
unique individuals in the purchase decision analysis of
Section 3.2. Panel B of Table A2 contains descriptive
statistics on these individuals for a random year. For all
the socio-demographic variables (age, income, wealth, and
all the peer group variables, including plant and zip code
size), the movers are on average very similar to the overall
sample.
3. The purchase decision
In this section, we relate the decision of an individual to
purchase common stocks in a given month with purchasing activity of coworkers. The motivation is simple: More
trading by coworkers is expected to create more buzz
about the stock market and make the individual more
likely to also trade.
3.1. Basic results
Our main dependent variable is buyi;t a dummy variable
that takes the value one if individual i makes a purchase in
month t and that is zero otherwise.
We estimate the following relation at the individualmonth level:
buyi;t ¼ β1 Buyplant
þbΓ þ εi;t :
i;t

ð1Þ

is the fraction of coworkers who purchase a stock
Buyplant
i;t
that month (not including i himself) at the plant where
individual i works. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of
11
In addition, we require that the investor moves at most four times
between 1993 and 2005, that the start date at the new plant is later than
the stop date at the previous plant, and that the unemployment spell (if
any) lasts less than six months. These three criteria exclude only a very
small fraction of moves. For some individuals, plant information is
missing at the end of year t  2. For these individuals, we require them
to have worked at the old plant for at least 18 months.

our main dependent and independent variables. In Eq. (1),
the estimated β1 captures the extent to which the individual's purchasing activity is correlated with that of his
coworkers. Γ is a column vector of control variables, and b
is a row vector of coefficients. The socio-demographic
controls are age, wealth, labor income, sex, the number
of years of education, and various powers thereof (see the
caption to Table 2 for specifics). For income and wealth, we
use the values reported in last year's tax return. We also
zip
include Buyfam
i;t and Buyi;t , which control for correlation in
timing of purchases inside the family, and within the zip
code, respectively and are defined in the same manner as
Buyplant
. Importantly, all of these variables exclude the
i;t
individual because otherwise a mechanical relation would
exist between the individual and the peer group. We
include a set of month dummies (132 in total) that control
for time-varying aggregate patterns in trading behavior. To
control for contextual effects, we include plant fixed
effects. For the same reason, we include zip code fixed
effects. We report t-statistics based on robust standard
errors clustered (two-way) around time and plant. Similar
regression models that link individual behavior to mean
group behavior have been used by, e.g., Bertrand, Luttmer,
and Mullainathan (2000), Duflo and Saez (2002), and
Ivković and Weisbenner (2007).
To estimate Eq. (1), we use the linear probability model as
our benchmark and verify robustness using the conditional
fixed effects logit estimator. In settings such as Eq. (1), where
many fixed effects need to be estimated, it is not obvious
whether linear or nonlinear regression models are more
appropriate. The disadvantage with the linear probability
model is that predicted probabilities could lie below zero or
above one. However, the nonlinear alternatives also have
disadvantages. First, introducing fixed effects can imply inconsistent estimates due to the incidental parameters problem
(see Neyman and Scott, 1948; Lancaster, 2000). The degree of
inconsistency depends on the number of observations per
fixed effect (Hsiao, 1986; Heckman, 1979), which means that
including many controls for unobserved heterogeneity makes
the incidental parameter problem more severe (omitting fixed
effects is particularly problematic in probit and logit estimations because the estimates will be inconsistent even if the
fixed effect is uncorrelated with other explanatory variables;
see Yatchew and Griliches, 1985). Taken together, this implies
that including an extensive amount of fixed effects leads to
inconsistent estimates in the nonlinear setting. The same
holds if we relevant fixed effects are excluded. Arguably, the
best nonlinear model in our setting is the conditional fixed
effects logit model of Chamberlain (1980), which bypasses the
incidental parameters problem by not estimating the fixed
effects. However, a disadvantage of the conditional fixed
effects logit model is that, because the fixed effects are not
estimated, this implies that the marginal effects are of limited
use (see Greene, 2012, p. 763, footnote 32).
Panel A of Table 2 presents the empirical results. Column 3
is the main specification. The estimated β1 is positive and
highly significant. In terms of economic magnitude, in Column
(3), a 1 standard deviation increase in coworker trading
activity (Buyplant
i;t ) results in an increase in trading activity of
40.90% relative to the unconditional mean [0.183 (point
estimate from Model 3) times 0.116 (standard deviation of

H.K. Hvide, P. Östberg / Journal of Financial Economics 117 (2015) 628–652

633

Buyplant )] divided by 0.0519 (the mean of buy).12 In Column 4,
we account for time-variant changes at the plant or zip code–
level by including yearly plant and zip code fixed effects. The
point estimate of β1 is similar to that reported in Column 3. In
addition, we consider specifications without fixed effects. In
this case, the point estimates and economic magnitudes are
larger than for Column 3.
The zip code-level correlation in trading behavior is
significantly reduced when workplace peer effects are introduced. The introduction of coworkers reduces the impact of
neighbors by roughly 20% (comparing Column 2 with 3). The
difference is statistically significant at the 1% level. In contrast,
the impact of workplace peers is much less affected by the
introduction of neighbors (3% reduction, when going from
Column 1 to 3). This is what would be expected if the positive
correlation at the zip code level is partially driven by coworkers who live close to each other. In addition, in unreported
analysis, we find that the introduction of socio-demographic
controls reduces the impact of neighborhood peers, while the
impact of coworkers is less affected.
The results could be driven by events in the industry or
in the region, such as writings in industry journals or in
local newspapers. In Specification 5, we account for timevariant industry-specific events by including monthly
industry-level fixed effects. This affects the estimated
coworker peer effect only to a minor extent. We account
for time-variant local events by including a fixed effect for
each municipality-year combination in our data set (there
are 459 municipalities in Norway). The results, reported in
Column 6, are similar to those reported in Column 3.13
In the stock market participation model of Hong, Kubik,
and Stein (2004), some investors are susceptible to social
influence and some are not. In an unreported analysis, we
consider whether socio-demographic characteristics are
related to the strength of coworker peer effects. We find
that coworkers exert a greater influence on males. We find
no relation to age or the level of education.
The extant literature shows that individual investors
have a preference for local stocks (e.g., Coval and
Moskowitz, 1999; Huberman, 2001) and stocks from their
industry of employment (Døskeland and Hvide, 2011). In
unreported analysis, we create new dummy variables that
indicate whether the purchase made was local (the firm's
headquarters is not more than one hundred kilometers
away from the zip code where the individual lives) or
within the industry of employment (the stock two-digit
NACE code matches that of the plant). Using these dummy

variables, we verify that coworker peer effects are present
across local, nonlocal, same-industry, and differentindustry stocks. In Section 4, which covers stock selection,
we also verify that those results are not restricted to local
and same-industry stocks (see Table 9).14
We also examine whether the peer effects that we find
are restricted to particular industries. Table A3 estimates a
separate coworker peer effect for each of 36 industries that
represent a significant proportion of the sample (no single
industry accounts for more than 12% of the investor
observations). These results strongly indicate that correlation in trading behavior among coworkers is universal
across industries.
A drawback of the linear probability model (LPM) is
that it can imply predicted probabilities outside the unit
interval. In Panel C, we reestimate Eq. (1) using the
conditional fixed effects logit estimator.15 We report odds
ratios of our main variables and z-statistics based on
standard errors clustered around plant.16 The lower number of observations in this panel is due to the conditional
fixed effect estimator requiring variation in the dependent
variable within each group (plant  postcode). So plants
with very few individuals (or relatively few individuals
and a short time series) are dropped from the estimation.
Consistent with the results in Panel A, we find that the
effect of Buyplant
is statistically significant at the 1% level. In
i;t
Specification 3, the coworker peer effect has an odds ratio
of 10.24. So, if Buyplant
goes from zero to one, the odds
i;t
increase roughly tenfold.
Social interaction can also affect sell decisions. Sells are
restricted to stocks already owned by the individual (very
few individual investors go short), and we therefore expect
coworkers to have a positive effect on individual sells but a
weaker effect than on purchases [for a related argument,
see Barber and Odean (2008)]. To investigate the role of
social interaction in sells, we define selli;t , a dummy
variable that takes the value one if the individual makes
a sale in month t and that otherwise is zero. Our main
plant
explanatory variable is Selli;t , which is the fraction of the
individual's coworkers making a sale in month t. In Panel B
of Table 2, we reestimate Eq. (1) using sale analogues. We
consider the same specifications as in Panel A. Our results
do suggest a positive peer effect on sells, but significantly
smaller than on purchases. In Column 3, a 1 standard

12
The estimated impact of family and neighbors is lower. A 1 standard
deviation increase is associated with an increase in trading activity of
23% ½ð0:1361
0:88Þ=0:0519
and
19% ½ð0:0369  0:272Þ=0:0519,
respectively.
13
We also consider the influence of non-coworkers on the individual
as a placebo test. We construct an analogue to Buyplant for all noncoworkers (Buynon-plant), capturing the purchasing intensity of noncoworkers. Because each of our plants represent a small fraction of the
economy, there is very limited variation across plants in Buynon-plant and,
therefore, collinearity with our time fixed effects. When we exclude time
fixed effects, we find that Buynon-plant is positively related to the
individual's purchase decision. This is not surprising because Buynonplant
captures economy-wide sentiment. However, as expected, the
economic impact of non-coworkers is limited when compared with
actual coworkers (less than one-fifteenth).

14
In unreported regressions, we find that coworker same-industry
purchases have a greater effect on individual same-industry purchases
than on coworker non-same-industry purchases. This is not surprising if
the coworker and the individual purchase the same stock. Because we
examine whether the individual purchases the same stocks as his coworkers (see Section 4), we omit these results for brevity.
15
Chamberlain (1980) shows that this estimator avoids the incidental parameter problem (Neyman and Scott, 1948) that arises in a probit or
logit model when fixed effects are estimated. This is particularly useful in
this context because there are 164,713 postcode-plant categories implying relatively few observations per fixed effect.
16
When using the conditional fixed effects logit, it is natural to
report odds ratios. The reason is that all of the independent variables
affect marginal effects in the logit setting and the fixed effects (postcodeplant in our context) are not estimated. Greene (2012, p. 763) notes:

deviation increase in Selli;t
is associated with a 14.33%
increase (relative to the unconditional mean) in the likelihood that the individual makes a sale in that month. A ttest of the difference between the point estimate of
plant
Buyplant
and Selli;t
is statistically significant at the 1%
i;t
level, confirming that peer effects are larger for purchases
than sales.17 The vector Γ contains the same controls as in
Panel A.
In Panel D, we revisit the sales analysis using conditional fixed effects logit estimation. Qualitatively, the
results are similar to those found in Panel B. For all three
peer groups, an increase in the fraction of peers that
undertake a sale results in higher selling activity of the
individual. In Specification 3, the odds ratio associated
plant
with Selli;t is 2.484 which is substantially lower than for
purchases (10.240, Specification 3 of Panel C). Overall, the
conditional fixed effects analysis complements our LPM
results, and it is reassuring that the results are qualitatively
similar.

3.2. Changes in place of work
Workers with similar unobserved characteristics, such
as risk preferences or investment style, could self-select to
the same plants in a pattern not captured by the control
variables. The data allow us to track individuals who move
(footnote continued)
“Because the fixed effects are not estimated, it is not possible to compute
probabilities or marginal effects with these estimated coefficients, and it
is a bit ambiguous what one can do with the results of the computations.”
We cluster only in the plant dimension because the conditional fixed
effects estimator cannot accommodate standard errors clustered in
multiple dimensions (see Cameron and Miller, 2010).
17
Corresponding differences for the family and zip code peer groups
are statistically significant at the 1% and 10% level, respectively.

between plants, down to a monthly level.18 Workers who
move between plants allow for a placebo test. We analyze
how individual purchases relate to the purchase activity of
future coworkers. The idea is that future coworkers are
unlikely to influence via social interaction but can still
exhibit correlated behavior due to similarity along unobservables. Thus, if unobserved similarities drive the results,
we would expect the correlation with future coworkers to
be of comparable magnitude to the correlation with
current coworkers.
Considering workers who move between plants also
provides an intuitive way to deal with the reflection
problem, i.e., that the estimated coefficients in Table 2
reflect both the influence of the group on the individual
and the influence of the individual on the group. One can
argue that recently arrived individuals are much less likely
to influence the incumbent group at the new plant than
vice versa (at least for some time) and that identification of
peer effects is in that case quite sharp. One can think of
exceptions to this rule, such as an academic department
hiring a new star scientist or a firm hiring a new manager.
The much more common experience, according to the
social psychology and sociology literature, is that listening
and adaptation is the prevalent mode in a new job at least
for a few months (e.g., van Maanen, 1976; Moreland, 1985;
Ashfort and Saks, 1996). For example, Ashfort and Saks
(1996, p. 149) state: “Individuals are particularly susceptible to influence during role transitions, such as organizational entry, because of the great uncertainty regarding
role requirements.”
To analyze the impact of new and former coworkers,
we interact the fraction of new and former coworkers who

Bodnaruk (2009) uses investor moves to show that individuals
shift their portfolios toward stocks that become local.

make a purchase in a given month with dummy variables
that indicate whether that month is prior to leaving
(joining) the former (new) plant or not. For more than
80% of moves, the individual moves straight from the old
plant to the new plant, without gap months. In this case,
these two dummy variables are the complements to each
before
other. The variable Buyold
is the fraction of former
i;t
coworkers who make a purchase prior to the individual
leaving the old plant (this variable takes the value zero
after
after leaving the old plant), and the variable Buyold
is
i;t
the fraction of former coworkers who make a purchase
after the individual has left the old plant (this variable
takes the value zero before leaving the old plant). The
variables describing the purchase activity of new plant
before
after
coworkers, Buynew
and Buynew
, are defined in the
i;t
i;t
same manner. In addition, we restrict the sample to 12
months before the individual leaves the old plant and 12
months after joining the new plant. We exclude the month
in which the individual leaves the old plant and the month
when he joins the new plant because they cannot be
clearly assigned to either before or after the move. Later
on, we take the analysis one step further and estimate
separate effects for each month. We estimate

Estimating Eq. (2) allows us to track how the correlation in
behavior with different coworkers evolves over time. It is
conceivable that trading frequency changes in connection
with a move (for example, due to severance packages or
time constraints). The vector Γ, therefore, includes, in
addition to the same socio-demographic control variables
and fixed effects as in Column 3 of Table 2, dummies for
the number of months before leaving from the old plant
and dummies for the number of months prior to joining
the new plant.
We start out by focusing attention to the months prior
to leaving the old plant. Column 1 of Table 3 considers the
effect of coworkers at the old plant before leaving. The
estimated coefficient is similar to the estimated coefficient
on coworkers for the overall sample, in Column 3 of
Table 2.
In Column 2 of Table 3, we perform the placebo test by
relating individual purchases to that of future coworkers.
The coefficient on future coworkers is positive, but small
and barely significant. Thus, endogenous group membership does not appear to be a major concern. In Column 3,
we include both current and future coworkers. The placebo coefficient from Column 2 is reduced by more than a
before
fourth, while the coefficient on Buyold
is not signifii;t
cantly affected. In Columns 4–6, we perform the same
exercise on months after joining the new plant. The
coefficient on new coworkers in Column 5 is again very
similar to the overall sample, Column 3 of Table 2. The
coefficient on new coworkers is not substantially affected
by including a control for previous coworkers, as seen
from Column 6. Also, the correlation with previous coworkers cannot be used as a placebo test, because the
individual is likely to stay in touch with former coworkers.

Column 7 shows that the correlation with former coworkers significantly drops after the individual leaves the
old plant (the before–after difference is significantly different from zero at the 1% level). In Column 8, we address
the reflection problem by considering the correlation with
new coworkers the year after the individual has joined the
plant. As argued above, β4 in Column 8 is likely to be
mainly driven by influence from the incumbent group of
workers on the individual. The estimated β4 is similar to
that reported in Column 5.
In Column 9, we include all sample months and
consider the full specification described in Eq. (2). All the
coefficients are similar to those reported in Columns 1–8.
Finally, in Column 10, we restrict the sample to those
individuals who do not change the municipality where
they live or the municipality where they work in conjunction with the change in plant. The results are similar.
To consider how the relation with the two peer groups
evolves over time in more detail, we move to the monthly
level. Let t denote event time in months. For example,
t ¼ 12 denotes 12 months prior to leaving the old plant
and t¼12 denotes 12 months after joining the new plant.
Furthermore, we define 25 dummy variables f1t gt ¼  12;12 .
Each dummy equals one for month t and zero otherwise (e.
g., 13 ¼ 1 if t¼3 and zero otherwise). We interact f1t g with
old
new
Buyplant
and Buyplant
and estimate the following
i;t
i;t
regression:
buyi;t ¼

ðβold;t Buyplant
i;t

t ¼  12

þ βnew;t Buyplant

ð3Þ

The vector Γ contains the same controls as used when we
estimated Eq. (2) and are described in the caption to
Table 2.19 The coefficients βold;t and β new;t capture the
correlation with former and new coworkers in month t,
after controlling for fixed effects. A large fraction of
individuals leave their jobs in December and join their
new job in January. To illustrate that the results are robust
to these individuals, we exclude them when estimating Eq.
(3), but they are kept in Table 3 (the previous table). The
results of this regression are exhibited in Fig. 1. Month 0 in
Fig. 1 is the month when the individual leaves the
old plant.
19
The regression specification in Eq. (3) is a slight simplification of
the actual regression specification. First, to capture the less than 20% of
the sample that moves with a gap month between the old plant and the
new plant, we estimate

buyi;t ¼

13

βt Buyplant

t ¼  13

ð4Þ

where f1old;t g and f1new;t g are dummies that are complements only for
moves with no gap. For the less than 20% of moves in which the number
of gap months g exceeds zero, we keep the gap months but drop the g
months on each extremity of the time window. For example, if an
individual has g ¼1, then we drop the 12th month before leaving the
old plant and the 12th month after joining the new plant. Second, to
calculate the moving average of coefficients in Fig. 1, we include
interaction effects for month 13 prior to leaving the old plant and month
13 after joining the new plant.

We examine the relative impact of new and former coworkers before and after the investor leaves (joins) the old (new) plant. To do so, we create two
dummy variables that take the value of one for months before (after) the investor leaves the old plant and zero otherwise. Similarly, we create two dummy
variables that take the value of one for months before (after) the investor joins the new plant and zero otherwise. We interact these four dummy variables

of months prior to joining the new plant (time prior joining). There is one dummy variable for each month starting from 12 months before the investor
leaves (joins) the old (new) plant to 12 months after (Month 0 is omitted). In Column 10, we consider only those individuals who do not change the
municipality where they live or work in conjunction with the plant move. t-statistics (in parentheses) are based on robust two-way (plant and time)

In Fig. 1, the blue dashed line depicts how newly
employed individuals are influenced by their peers. The
sharp ascent of the blue line around Month 0 reveals that
the correlation with new coworkers is initially low but
becomes substantial after a very short period in the new
job. This is consistent with the individual gradually
becoming socialized and adopting the investment behavior of his peers. The red solid line in Fig. 1 illustrates how
the correlation with past coworkers evolves over time. The
correlation with former coworkers decreases significantly
when the individual leaves the old plant.
These findings give strong support to the notion that
social interaction in the workplace influences individuals'
decision to purchase stocks. We find it striking how the
correlation with different sets of coworkers evolves in a
pattern that reflects proximity to those coworkers.
3.3. Can shocks at the plant-month level drive the results?
The results could be driven by events at the plantmonth level, such as visits from equity brokers or from
investment advisers. We deal with this issue in two ways.
First, if plant-month shocks are behind the results, we
would expect a similar correlation in trading behavior

between pairs of individuals at small and large plants. If
social interaction drives our results, we would expect
stronger correlation between individuals at a small plant
than at a large plant, simply because two individuals are
more likely to engage at a small plant. To test this
hypothesis, for each month we rank all plants into ten
size deciles, based on number of employees. We then
sample two individuals from each plant-month and estimate the within-plant correlation in purchasing activity
across size deciles. For each of the plant size deciles, we
estimate the following regression:
buyi;t ¼ β1 buyj;t þ bΓ þ εi;t ;

ð5Þ

where buyj;t is a dummy variable that takes the value one if
coworker j makes a purchase in month t and otherwise it is
zero.20 As before, we include Buyfam
and Buyzip
i;t
i;t , as well as
socio-demographic controls and month and plant fixed effects.
Panel A of Table 4 presents our point estimates of β1 for
all size deciles. We also tabulate the mean number of
employees for each size decile. In smaller plants, the effect
20
Bayer, Ross, and Topa (2008) use a similar regression strategy to
study the role of informal networks in job hiring.

638

of coworkers is much larger than in larger plants. It is
striking that as the number of workers increases from 4.74
(Decile 1) to 21.91 (Decile 4), the peer effect is reduced
threefold.
We benchmark the peer effect by estimating a placebo
effect. First, we match each selected individual with a
randomly chosen individual from a different plant within
his size decile (the placebo coworker). We then reestimate
Eq. (5) using the buying intensity of the placebo coworker.
Panel B of Table 4 tabulates the associated point estimates
of the effect of the placebo coworkers. As expected, the
estimated effect is economically marginal, and it is statistically significant only for one size decile.
Fig. 2 plots the effect [β1 from estimating Eq. (5)] of
coworkers (red solid line) and placebo coworkers (blue
dashed line) for different plant sizes. There is a sharp
decrease in the effect of coworkers (y-axis) going from
Decile 1 to Decile 5. In addition, in Deciles 1 through 4, the
effect of coworkers is significantly greater than the effect
of placebo peers.
Following Duflo and Saez (2002), a third way to deal
with the possibility of shocks at the plant-month level is to
exploit that peer groups are likely to form among individuals with similar socio-demographic characteristics. For
example, females could talk more with females than with
males, and individuals in the same age group could be
more likely to talk with each other. In Table A4, we regress
individual purchases on purchases made for each subgroup separately. The estimated peer group coefficients
are more often than not larger within subgroups than
between subgroups.

4. Stock selection
In this section, we consider the relation between an
individual's stock selection and the stock selection decisions made by his coworkers. The motivation is simple:
Coworkers are likely to discuss their stock selection
decisions and thereby attract attention to the stocks
selected. The regression methodology is similar to the
one applied by Ivković and Weisbenner (2007) in the
study of industry selection.
We create a variable f i;t;s , which equals the fraction of
total purchases by investor i in month t that is made in
stock s. We restrict our attention to only those months in
which the individual makes at least one purchase. An
advantage of considering the stock selection decision is
that it is less influenced by liquidity shocks than the
purchase decision. The dependent variable, f i;t;s , is defined
P
for all stocks present in that month, and
s f i;t;s ¼ 1 by
construction. As a main explanatory variable, we construct
an analogous variable, F plant
i;t;s , which is the fraction of
purchases made by individual i's coworkers (excluding
the individual's purchases) that is invested in stock s. This
variable is defined only if at least one coworker makes a
purchase in month t (if we did not condition on a
purchase, the variable would confound stock selection
with the decision to be active). Table 5 provides descriptive
statistics. The mean fraction of total purchases invested in
a stock is 0.49%, which makes intuitive sense because

there are roughly two hundred stocks on the OSE over the
sample period.

4.1. Basic results
To relate individual stock selection to that of his coworkers, we estimate the following regression:
f i;t;s ¼ β1 F plant
i;t;s þ bΓ þ εi;t;s :

ð6Þ

The coefficient β1 captures the extent to which stock
selection of an individual is correlated with that of coworkers. To accommodate that a particular plant has a
preference for a particular stock, we include fixed effects
for each stock-plant combination in Γ. These control, for
example, for the possibility that a plant has a business
relation with a particular listed company. To account for
local bias and other geographical effects, we include zip
code–stock fixed effects. We also include monthly stock
dummies (one for each stock) to control for time-varying
aggregate patterns in the demand for individual stocks
[such as individual investors pursuing glitter stocks as in
Barber and Odean (2008) or stocks with strong prior
performance, as in Benartzi (2001)]. As additional controls,
we include zip code–level stock selection, F zip
i;t;s , which is
plant
zip
defined in the same manner as F plant
.
Both
F
i;t;s
i;t;s and F i;t;s
sum to one across stocks in a given month.
The results are presented in Table 6. In the regressions,
there are 87; 812; 052 observations, which correspond to
roughly 440,000 purchase months or 3.7 purchase months
per investor in the sample [the individual trading patterns
reported here are similar to those found in Døskeland and
Hvide (2011)]. Column 3 is the main specification. The
estimated β1 coefficient is positive and highly significant.
In terms of economic magnitude, in Column 3, a 1
standard deviation increase in the fraction of coworkers'
purchases allocated to a particular stock results in a 194%
increase in the fraction of that month's purchases allocated
to that stock by the individual.21 In Columns 4 to 8, we
consider alternative fixed effects. As evidenced by Column
4, the introduction of plant-year-stock and postcode-yearstock fixed effects does not qualitatively alter the results.
Neither does introducing municipality-stock fixed effects
(Column 6).22
21
The economic impact is calculated as 0.196 [point estimate from
Specification (3)]  0.0486 (standard deviation of Fplant) / 0.0049 (the
mean of f). From Column 2 and 3: the correlation with geographical
neighbors drops when coworker stock selection is included. The converse
is not the case. The correlation with coworkers is hardly affected by
introducing neighbors, as seen by contrasting Columns 1 and 3. This is
consistent with correlation at the zip code partly proxying for social
interaction in the workplace.
22
We do not control for family group stock selection, as this would
leave us with a very small sample size. We verify that the estimated
coefficient on F plant
i;t;s is very similar for this subsample also after controlling for F fam
i;t;s . We also examine the effect of noncoworkers on stock
selection. We calculate F nonplant
as the fraction of non-coworker puri;t;s
chases invested in stock s in month t. Unfortunately, little variation
emerges across individuals in F nonplant
in a particular month, which
i;t;s
implies that collinearity exists between F nonplant
and the month  stock
i;t;s
fixed effects. When we exclude month  stock fixed effects, both F nonplant
i;t;s
plant
and F i;t;s are statistically and economically significant.

Table 4
Interaction in peer groups of different size.
We examine whether the impact of coworkers depends on plant size. For each month, we sample two individuals from each plant, denoted by worker i
and worker j, and rank plants into ten size deciles, according to the number of workers in total at the plant. We estimate the following equation for each
size decile:
buyi;t ¼ αt þ β1 buyj;t þ β2 Buyfamily
þ β3 Buyzip
i;t
i;t þ bΓ þ εi;t ;
where buyi;t takes the value one if worker i makes a purchase in month t and zero otherwise, and buyj;t is the corresponding dummy variable for worker j.
The vector Γ includes the socio-demographic variables listed in the caption to Table 2 as well as time and plant fixed effects. In Panel A, we present point
estimates of β1 with corresponding t-statistics (standard errors are clustered around plant and time), the number of individual month observations used in
the regression, and the mean number of employees in the size decile. Panel B contains a placebo analysis where we estimate the above equation after
randomly pairing two individuals from different plants in the same size decile. The number of observations and the mean number of employees are
identical to those in Panel A by construction. n, and nnn indicate statistical significance at the 10%, and 1% level, respectively. The sample period is January
1995 to December 2005.

Fig. 2. Slope coefficients from estimating Eq. (5). We divide all of our
plants into size deciles in terms of the number of employees in each
month. From each plant, we sample two individuals (investor i and
coworker j). We relate the purchase decision of i (buyi;t ) to that of j (buyj;t )
by estimating the regression described in Eq. (5) for each size decile. The
red solid line plots the estimated slope coefficients from the regressions.
The blue dashed line, the placebo effect, plots the corresponding slope
coefficients after matching investor i with a randomly chosen worker
from a different plant in the same size decile.

4.2. Changes in place of work
To analyze the impact of new and former coworkers on
stock selection, we interact the fraction of former and new
coworkers who make a purchase in a particular stock in a
given month with dummy variables that indicate whether
that month is prior to leaving (joining) the old (new) plant
before
or not. For example, the variable F old
is the fraction
i;t;s

invested in stock s by former coworkers prior to the
investor leaving the old plant. After the departure date,
the variable takes the value zero. Similarly, the variable
after
F old
is the fraction invested by coworkers at the old
i;t;s
plant in stock s after the individual has left the plant.
Before that, the variable takes the value of zero. The
variables describing the stock selection of new plant cowbefore
after
orkers, F new
and F new
, are defined in the same
i;t;s
i;t;s
manner. As in the purchase decision analysis, we restrict
the sample to 12 months before the individual leaves the
old plant and 12 months after joining the new plant. The
above mentioned selection criteria leaves 6,458 individuals. The socio-demographic characteristics of these
individuals with respect to age, income, wealth, etc., are
very similar to that covered in the other parts of the paper.

To control for geographical differences in preferences for
certain stocks, we include zip code–stock fixed effects in Γ.
As additional controls, we include zip code-level stock
selection, F zip
i;t;s . The sample size is not sufficient to include
plant-stock fixed effects, which means that the level of the
coefficients estimated here are contaminated by plantspecific preferences for particular stocks, and the analysis
mainly has interest in illustrating differences between the
estimated coefficients in Eq. (7).
The results are presented in Table 7. We start out by
confining attention to the months prior to leaving the old
plant. In Column 1, we consider the effect of coworkers at
the old plant before leaving that plant. In Column 2, we
relate individual purchases to that of future coworkers.

The coefficient is noticeably smaller than the coefficient
measuring the effect of current coworkers found in Column 1. The magnitude and statistical significance of the
coefficient is likely to be related to the omission of plantstock fixed effects. In Column 3, we include as regressors
the stock selection of both current and future coworkers.
Neither of the coefficients from Column 1 or Column 2 is
much affected. In Columns 4–6, we repeat the exercise of
the previous three columns, but we now focus on the 12
months after the individual has joined the new plant.
Notably, the coefficient on the stock selection of new
coworkers is not affected by including a control for
previous coworkers, as seen from Column 6.
Columns 7–9 combine the period before the move with
the period after joining the new plant. Column 7 shows
that the correlation with new coworkers significantly
increases after the individual joins the new plant (the
before–after difference is significantly different from zero
at the 1% level). As in Section 3.2, the difference between
these two coefficients is likely to be largely driven by
influence from the incumbent group of workers on the
individual. In Column 9, we consider the full specification
described in Eq. (7). All the coefficients are similar to those
reported in Columns 1–8. Finally, in Column 10, we restrict
the sample to those individuals who do not change the
municipality where they live or the municipality where
they work in conjunction with the change in plant.
To consider how the relation with the peer group
evolves over time in more detail, we move to the monthly
level. Let t denote event time in months. We estimate the
following regression:
f i;t;s ¼

12
X

ðβold;t F plant
i;t;s

t ¼  12

old

þ βnew;t F plant
i;t;s

new

Þ1t þ bΓ þ εi;t;s :
ð8Þ

The vector Γ contains the same controls as Eq. (7). The
coefficients βold;t and βnew;t capture the correlation with
former and new coworkers in month t, after controlling for
fixed effects. The results of this regression are exhibited in
Fig. 3.
In Fig. 3, we plot the interacted peer coefficient against
the number of months before the move. Fig. 3 looks similar
to Fig. 1.23 Prior to the move, the effect of former
23

We do not include plant-stock fixed effects, so that the level of the
estimates is affected by plant-specific preferences for particular stocks.

coworkers is greater than the effect of new coworkers.
However, following the move, the effect of new coworkers
surpasses that of former coworkers. Thus, the investment
decisions of individuals is most affected by those peers
they interact with the most.
If plant-month shocks are behind the results, we would
expect a similar correlation in trading behavior between
pairs of individuals at small and large plants. If social
interaction drives our results, we would expect stronger
correlation between individuals at a small plant than at a
large plant, because two individuals are more likely to
engage at a small plant. To test this hypothesis, from each
plant-month we keep the stock selection decision of one
individual and one of his coworkers. We divide all of our
plants into ten size deciles and for each decile we estimate
the following regression (the stock selection analogue to
Section 3.3):
f i;t;s ¼ β1 f j;t;s þbΓ þ εi;t;s ;

ð9Þ

where f j;t;s is the allocation of coworker j to stock s in
month t. We control for stock selection at the postcode
level by including F zip
i;t;s in Γ. We also include plant-stock
and month-stock fixed effects. As before, our standard
errors are clustered both at the time and plant level. Panel
A of Table 8 presents our point estimates of β1 for all size
deciles. The point estimate for Decile 1 is more than five
times as large as the point estimate for Decile 10. The
mean number of employees in Decile 1 is 7.22 versus
1; 464:67 for Decile 10.
We benchmark the peer effect by reestimating Eq. (9)
when the individual is paired with a random noncoworker in the same size decile. Panel B of Table 8
tabulates the associated point estimates of the effect of
placebo peers on the stock selection decision of our
individuals. As expected, they are markedly lower than
those reported in Panel A.
Fig. 4 plots the effect [β1 from Eq. (9)] of coworkers (red
solid line) and placebo peers (blue dashed line) for
different plant sizes. There is a rapid decrease in the peer
effect when going from Decile 1 to 4 (the mean plant in
Decile 4 has 61.87 employees). From Decile 4 to 10, there
seems to be a more gradual decrease. However, the effect
(footnote continued)
Thus, we are mainly interested in the difference between points on the
red line and points on the blue line.

4.3. Same-industry and local stock purchases
In the previous subsections, we find a close relation
between the investment decisions of the individual and

his coworkers. However, it is still an open question
whether this is beneficial. In this subsection, we take a
first step (see also Section 5) in considering the effect of
social interaction on the quality of investment decisions by
determining whether social interaction contributes to the
purchase of stocks that most likely are poor hedges of
income risk (same-industry stocks; Døskeland and Hvide,

Fig. 3. Slope coefficients from regression equation (8). The dependent
variable f i;t;s , is the fraction invested by investor i in stock s in month t.
Our main independent variables are the fraction invested in stock s in
month t of old (new) coworkers interacted with 27 dummy variables, one
for each of the 13 months prior to leaving the old plant to 13 months after
joining the new plant. We average three consecutive coefficients, and we
plot the estimated coefficients from 12 months prior to leaving the old
plant to 12 months after joining the new plant. 0 is the start date of new
job and end date of old job. We exclude investors who leave their job in
December and join the new plant in January.

2011) and exposure to local economic conditions (local
stocks; e.g., Coval and Moskowitz, 1999).24 Thus, purchases
of same-industry and local stocks are likely to be less than
ideal from a diversification perspective.25
Meanwhile, local and same-industry stocks likely are
salient objects of workplace conversations and, thus, social
interaction effects could be stronger for local and sameindustry stocks than for nonlocal and different-industry
stocks. To this end, in what follows we examine coworker
peer effects for these different types of stocks.
For each individual employed in the private sector, the
data set contains an employer two-digit NACE code at
year-end. For each stock on the OSE, we have the primary
NACE codes at year-end from 1996 to 2005 (for 1995 we
impute the NACE codes from 1996). Following Døskeland
and Hvide (2011), we define a same-industry stock as a
stock in which the worker two-digit NACE code matches
the NACE code of the stock. We classify a stock as being
local to the individual if the distance from the place of
residence of the individual to the stock headquarters is less
than one hundred kilometers (km). We create four new
sameindustry
diff :industry
local
dependent variables—f i;t;s
, f i;t;s
, f i;t;s , and
nonlocal
f i;t;s
— to capture the individual's selection of sameindustry, different-industry, local, and nonlocal stocks. For

24
The extant literature shows that the returns of within-industry
stocks are correlated with labor income (see Baxter and Jermann, 1997;
Eiling, 2013). In the same vein, Massa and Simonov (2006) show that
investors invest in stocks that have a high correlation with their
nonfinancial income, suggesting that investors do not use the stock
market for hedging.
25
Purchases of same-industry stocks could be a hedge against
negative shocks to own-firm performance. As the stock prices of firms
in the same industry tend to be strongly correlated, this does not seem
likely. Purchases of local stocks could be a hedge against shocks at the
local price level.

example, f i;t;s
is the fraction of total same-industry
purchases made in month t invested in stock s. The other
variables are defined analogously. Table A5 presents
descriptive statistics of the dependent variables.
In Table 9, we reestimate Eq. (6) using the new
dependent variables. In Column 1 to Column 4 we consider
local, nonlocal, same-industry, and different-industry
stocks, respectively. We include month-stock, plant-stock,
and zip code–stock fixed effects in all specifications. The
point estimate of F plant
i;t;s is always positive and statistically
significant, indicating that our previous results are not
driven by individual investor preferences for local or
same-industry stocks. As expected, we find evidence that
same-industry and local stocks are salient objects of
conversation in the workplace. Although peer effects affect
the selection of all four types of stock, the economic
impact of social interaction on stock selection is larger
for same-industry and local stocks than for their counterparts. A 1 standard deviation increase in the allocation of
coworkers to a particular stock increases the individuals
allocation to that stock by 211% for same-industry stocks
and 134% for different-industry stocks. The corresponding
numbers for local and nonlocal stocks are 183% and 157%,
respectively. Thus, the results confirm that the economic
impact is largest for those stocks that we expect to be
discussed most frequently at the workplace. In addition,
these results suggest that one possible cause of local bias
and within-industry bias is that social interaction centers
around these kind of stocks. Finally, from a diversification
perspective, both local and same-industry stocks are
arguably less than ideal and, therefore, this highlights that
social interaction could lead to a suboptimal portfolio
allocation.

5. Should people listen to their coworkers?
The literature on information cascades (Bikhchandani,
Hirshleifer, and Welch, 1992; Banerjee, 1992; Ellison and
Fudenberg, 1993) posits that imitating coworkers can
make investment decisions better informed and improve
investment returns. In this section, we evaluate how peer
pressure affects the performance of stock purchases using
calendar time methodology (see Odean, 1999; Seasholes
and Zhu, 2010). We measure peer pressure as the fraction
of coworker purchases allocated to stock s in excess of the
economy-wide allocation to stock s. Hence, we rank all
purchases made according to
nonplant
F plant
;
i;t;s F i;t;s

ð10Þ

is the fraction of non-coworkers purchases
where F nonplant
i;t;s
allocated to stock s in month t.26 Effectively, F nonplant
i;t;s
controls for economy-wide trends. So we consider
instances in which coworkers are more enthusiastic about
a stock than the economy as a whole.
26
We have also ranked purchases in terms of Buyplant
 Buynonplant
,
i;t
i;t
which captures more general stock market enthusiasm because it does
not condition on the investor purchasing the same stock as his coworkers. The results suggest that there is no information in the enthusiasm
of coworkers.

Table 8
Interaction in peer groups of different size.
We examine the impact of coworkers in peer groups of different size. For each month, we sample two individuals from each plant, denoted by worker i
and worker j, and rank plants into ten size deciles, according to the number of workers in total at the plant. We estimate the following equation for each
size decile:
f i;t;s ¼ β1 f j;t;s þ β2 F zip
i;t;s þ bΓþ εi;t;s
where f j;t;s is the fraction of coworker j's purchases allocated to stock s in month t. We control for the stock selection of neighbors by including F zip
i;t;s . The
vector Γ includes plant  stock and month  stock fixed effects. In Panel A, we present point estimates of β1 with corresponding t-statistics (standard errors
are clustered at the plant and time level), the number of individual month observations used in the regression and the mean number of employees in the
size decile. In Panel B, we present the placebo analysis where we randomly pair two individuals from different plants in the same size decile. We reestimate
the above equation while replacing f j;t;s with the corresponding stock allocation of the placebo coworker. In Panel B, we present the estimates of β1 with tstatistics. The number of observations and the mean number of employees are identical to those in Panel A by construction. n, nn, and nnn indicate statistical
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively. The sample period is January 1995 to December 2005.

Panel B: Placebo peers
f j;t;s

Purchases made under above (below) median peer
pressure are sorted into the high (low) peer pressure
portfolio. Each purchase is given a unique entry into either
the high or the low peer pressure portfolio. For purchases
made in month t, we consider the difference in return
between the high peer pressure and the low peer pressure
purchases ðHP LPÞt in subsequent months.27 To evaluate
investor performance, we run the following regression:
ðHP  LPÞt ¼ α þ β1 MKT t þ β2 SMBt þ β3 HMLt þ β4 MOM t þ εt ;
ð11Þ
where the risk factors MKT (market), HML (high minus
low), SMB (small minus big), and MOM (momentum), are
all calculated for Norway by Ødegaard (2013).
In Panel A of Table 10, we examine the returns to peer
purchases over different holding periods. We report
monthly percentage alphas and standard errors of the
long, the short, and the long-short portfolio. For all
considered holding periods—one, three, six, nine, and 12
months—the abnormal return to the high-minus-low peer
pressure portfolio is not statistically or economically significant. It is important to note that the calendar time
methodology implies that we have only one observation
for each month over the period 1994 to 2005, suggesting
that the power of our test is limited by the length of our
time series and that the standard errors of the alphas of
27
Because we consider the performance of purchases in month t þ 1
and onward we abstract from performance from the purchase day until
the end of month t. Barber and Odean (2000) account for the performance within the purchase month and conclude that this does not
qualitatively affect investor performance.

Fig. 4. Slope coefficients from estimating Eq. (9). In each month, we
divide all of our plants into size deciles by the number of employees.
From each plant, we sample two individuals (investor i and coworker j).
We relate the stock selection decision of i (f i;t;s ) to that of j (f j;t;s ) by
estimating the regression described in Eq. (9) for each size decile. The red
solid line plots the estimated slope coefficients from the regressions. The
blue dashed line, placebo effect, plots the corresponding slope coefficients after matching investor i with a randomly chosen worker from a
different plant in the same size decile.

the long and the short portfolio are large (around one).
This implies that, when examining the long and the short
portfolio separately, we have low power. Fortunately, the
standard errors of the alphas of the long-short portfolio
are much smaller. This suggests that the four-factor model
for Norway does not explain returns very well.

Table 9
Stock selection of local and same-industry stocks.
This table investigates the relation between the stock selection of peers and the stock selection of investors in local and same-industry stocks. The
following equation is estimated:
zip
f i;t;s ¼ β1 F plant
i;t;s þ β 2 F i;t;s þ bΓþ εi;t;s
zip
The dependent variable f i;t;s is the fraction of total purchases invested in stock s in month t by investor i. F plant
i;t;s and F i;t;s are the average fraction invested in

stock s in month t by plant and zip code peers, respectively. Column 1 considers only local stocks (stocks headquartered closer than one hundred kilometers
from the investor). Thus, the dependent variable f i;t;s measures the fraction of local purchases invested by the individual in stock s. Column 2 considers
nonlocal stocks only. Column 3 considers same-industry stocks (defined as in Døskeland and Hvide, 2011) only, and Column 4 considers different-industry
stocks. We include month  stock, plant  stock, zip  stock, and zip  plant  stock fixed effects. t-statistics (in parentheses) are based on robust two-way
(plant and time) clustered standard errors. nnn indicates statistical significance at the 1% level. The sample period is January 1995 to December 2005.

To verify that this result is not driven by the median
cutoff in terms of peer pressure, in unreported results we
also divide all purchases into quintiles on the basis of their
peer pressure and examine the relative performance of
extreme quintiles. Again, for all holding periods, we do not
find that peer pressure is associated with abnormal performance. Each column in Panel B of Table 10 examines the
return to the peer pressure portfolio for a particular month
after purchase. We consider the performance of the
ðHP LPÞt portfolio in months t þ2, t þ 3, t þ 4, t þ 5, and
t þ 6. For all of these months, we find that abnormal
returns are insignificant.
The preference for local and same-industry stocks
could be driven by individual investors profiting from
local information (Ivković and Weisbenner, 2005; Massa
and Simonov, 2006). Alternatively, investors could suffer
from a familiarity bias (Huberman, 2001), in which case
local and same-industry purchases should not be associated with any abnormal performance. In fact, the two
possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Some investors
could act on information while other investors buy what
they are familiar with. To evaluate the overall impact of
these two hypotheses, we separately consider all purchases of same-industry (same two digit NACE code) and
local (headquartered within one hundred km) stocks and
then sort these purchases in terms of peer pressure. As
before, purchases with above (below) median peer pressure are classified as having high (low) peer pressure.
Panels C, D, E and F of Table 10 display the results from
estimating Eq. (11) using as the dependent variable the
difference in return between high and low peer pressure
purchases of same-industry, different-industry, local, and
nonlocal stocks, respectively. In general, all of the panels
confirm the previous findings that peer pressure is not

associated with abnormal returns. Interestingly, high pressure same-industry purchases outperform low pressure
same-industry purchases by 0.42% per month (Panel C).
Although economically significant, the difference is measured with significant error and is not statistically significant. Over a three-month period, the positive returns turn
negative, and when considering a horizon of nine to 12
months, the high peer pressure portfolio under-performs
the low pressure portfolio, but again the performance
difference is not statistically significant. For differentindustry purchases, the difference between high and low
pressure purchases are universally economically and statistically insignificant. Taken together, the evidence does
not suggest that listening to coworkers adds value to
purchases.
In contrast, for local purchases, high peer pressure
purchases actually under-perform low peer pressure purchases. Over all horizons, the difference is negative. When
considering a three-month horizon, the monthly underperformance is  0.083% and statistically significant at the
10% level.
Taken together, these results suggest that it is unlikely
that information about stock fundamentals is transmitted
among coworkers. Overall, the results of this section
combined with the findings of the previous sections off
the paper lead us to conclude that individual investors
follow the advice of their coworkers even though the
advice does not contain value-pertinent information.
6. Conclusion
This paper addresses whether coworkers influence
investment choices, and whether such influence is useful
to the investor himself. We employ comprehensive data

pressure are placed in the high (low) pressure portfolio. Purchases are kept in the portfolio from the last day of the purchase month until the end of the
holding period (up to one year later). As the dependent variable we use the time series of monthly differences between the mean return of the high
pressure portfolio and the mean return of the low pressure portfolio (HP–LP). We estimate the following regression:
HP  LP t ¼ α þ β1 MKT t þ β2 SMBt þ β3 HMLt þ β4 MOM t þ εt
where MKT t , SMBt , HMLt , MOMt , are the Fama and French and the Carhart (1997) factors calculated for Norway by Ødegaard (2013). In Panel A, we present
results for holding periods one, three, six, nine and 12 months. Panel B presents the results for the individual months t þ2 to tþ 6. We report monthly
percentage alphas. In Panel C, we consider whether peer pressure affects the performance of same-industry purchases. To do this, in each month we rank
all same-industry purchases in terms of peer pressure and as before above (below) median purchases are placed in the high (low) pressure portfolio. Thus,
we reestimate the above equation with our dependent variable HP  LP t based on only same-industry purchases. Panel C reports point estimates of α over
several holding periods. Panel D, E, and F are identical to Panel C except that we consider only different-industry, local, and nonlocal purchases,
respectively. We report Newey and West (1987) standard errors with three lags. n, nn, and nnn indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels,

from Norway that cover a large number of individual
investors over a ten-year period. We find that the stock
market behavior of individual investors is highly correlated with the stock market behavior of their coworkers.
Sorting of unobservably similar individuals to the same
workplaces is unlikely to drive the results, as evidenced by
the trading behavior of individuals who move between
plants. As one would expect if the correlations are driven
by social interaction (and not shocks at the plant level), the
results are considerably stronger for small than for large
plants.
The results point to social interaction as an important
element in the investment behavior of individuals. Existing evidence in favor of social interaction comes from
relatively large peer groups, such as regions or neighborhoods. However, these findings are subject to several
interpretations (e.g., Moffitt, 2001). One contribution of
the analysis is to focus on peer effects at a much more local
level, the workplace, and to show that the measured social
interaction effects are large even after accounting for
correlated unobservables, endogenous group membership,
and reflection.
We also analyze whether social interaction leads to
better economic outcomes for the individuals who are

affected. Social interaction appears to increase purchase of
same-industry and local stocks, both less than ideal from a
diversification perspective. Second, we examine the performance of purchases made under greater peer pressure,
and do not find evidence suggesting abnormal returns. The
bottom line of the paper is that individuals are strongly
influenced by their coworkers, but this influence does not
improve investment quality.
A recent literature addresses the co-movement of
aggregate individual investor trading and asset returns
(e.g., Kumar and Lee, 2006; Barber and Odean, 2008). One
idea explored by this literature is that individual investors
can affect asset prices if their trading is sufficiently
correlated due to social movements (Shiller, 1984). A social
movement needs to start somewhere, and the workplace
is a plausible candidate. An interesting avenue for future
work is to test for social interaction between plants, using
movers or geographical proximity as possible drivers of
between-plant diffusion.

Table A2
Descriptive statistics of peer groups and socio-demographic variables.
This table presents descriptive statistics on the sample individuals: size of the individual's plant, zip code, and family (excluding the individual) and the
number of investors (i.e., individuals who trade at least once over the period 1995 to 2005 and are therefore included in the individual's peer group) in the
individuals' respective groups. In addition, we provide descriptive statistics on the socio-demographic variables wealth, income, age, male, and education.
The US dollar Norwegian kroner (NOK) exchange rate was 8.77 in December 2000. Number of trades is the number of months in the sample that the
individual makes at least one trade. Panel A samples a random year of each individual who is present at one time in our trade analysis. Analogously, Panel B
samples a random year of each individual present in our mover analysis (see Section 3.2). In Panel C, we consider a random year of all individuals present in
our stock selection analysis (Section 4). The sample period is January 1995 to December 2005.

Table A3
Industry decomposition of investors, firms, and coworker peer effects.
This table presents descriptive statistics on the industries that our investors work in (Column 1) and the industries that are represented on the Oslo Stock
Exchange (OSE) (Column 2). In addition, we decompose the coworker peer effect depending on the industry of employment of the investor. Financial firms
[Nomenclature Generale des Activites Economiques dans I'Union Europeenne (NACE) codes 65, 66, and 67] have been excluded from the sample. For this
table, we consider only industries that represent at least 0.4% of investor observations (i.e., the industry has at least roughly 420 investors). This restriction
implies a loss of less than 3% of the complete sample. To decompose the coworker peer effect across industries, we estimate the following regression:
buyi;t ¼ αt þ

36
X
j¼1

βj Buyplant
 I j þ β37 Buyfamily
þ β38 Buyzip
i;t
i;t
i;t þ bΓ þ εi;t ;

where I j is a dummy variable that takes a value of one if the investor works in industry j and zero otherwise. Column 3 reports the point estimates of the
peer effect for our 36 industries. The vector Γ of control variables includes the socio-demographic control variables listed in the caption to Table 2. In
addition to time (month), plant, and zip fixed effects, we include zip–plant interaction fixed effects. t-statistics (in Column 4) are based on robust two-way
(plant and time) clustered standard errors. nn, and nnn indicate statistical significance at the 5%, and 1% level, respectively. The sample period is January 1995
to December 2005.

Table A4
Subsample analysis.
This table examines whether peer effects are stronger among coworkers who are more likely to interact.
We classify coworkers along the dimensions of sex, tenure, age, education, and wealth. We sort coworkers
in each year and plant into two groups depending on sex (Panel A), median tenure (Panel B), median age
(Panel C), median education (Panel D), and median wealth (Panel E). For each group of coworkers, we
calculate the fraction of individuals who make a purchase in that month ðBuyGroup
i;t

1 plant

and BuyGroup
i;t

2 plant

Þ.

For both groups (for example, males are Group 1 and females are Group 2), we estimate the following
regression:
Group j

buyi;t

¼ αt þ β1 BuyGroup
i;t

1 plant

þ β2 BuyGroup
i;t

2 plant

þ β3 Buyfamily
þ β4 Buyzip

i;t þ bΓ þ εi;t:

The column Group 1 reports point estimates of β1 and β2 when the individual belongs to Group 1 [see Duflo
and Saez (2002) for an application of this methodology to pension plan enrollment]. We also report the pvalue of the F-test of a difference between β1 and β2 . The Column Group 2 presents the corresponding
results when the individual belongs to Group 2. The vector Γ of control variables are the socio-demographic
control variables listed in the caption to Table 2. In addition to time (month), plant, and zip fixed effects; we
include zip–plant interaction fixed effects. t-statistics (in parentheses) are based on robust two-way (plant
and time) clustered standard errors. nnn indicates statistical significance at the 1% level. The sample period
is January 1995 to December 2005.

Investor stock selection of local and same-industry stocks.
We examine individual stock selection of same-industry, different-industry, local, and nonlocal stocks (examined in Table 9). A local stock is
headquartered less than one hundred kilometers from the residence of the individual. Same-industry stocks have the same two digit Nomenclature
