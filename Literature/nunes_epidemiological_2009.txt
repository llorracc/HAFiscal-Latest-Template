Abstract
The sticky information setup assumes that information disseminates
slowly throughout the population, inducing interesting dynamics in macroeconomic models. Carroll (2003) estimates an epidemiological model of expectations, providing a microfoundation for the sticky information model
of Mankiw and Reis (2002). We show that this microfoundation is rather
weak. Firstly, it is hard to argue that professional forecasters formed expectations rationally. Second, if we estimate an equation where expectations
of households are updated towards rational expectations then the results
differ dramatically. Third, by examining the time series of the median
household forecaster we manage to invalidate the epidemiological microfoundation of sticky information models.

Introduction

Macroeconomics has recently started to pose alternatives to Rational Expectations (henceforth, RE). Estrella and Fuhrer (2002) show that a general class of
macroeconomic models exhibit inconsistencies under RE. Some departures from
RE that enhance the fit of macroeconomic models have been proposed. This
paper will focus on the departures from traditional RE proposed in Mankiw and
Reis (2002) (henceforth MR) and Carroll (2003, 2004) (henceforth, Carroll). MR

suggested a sticky information approach, where households form expectations
rationally but only revise them periodically. MR and Reis (2004) justify such
an approach on the grounds that it is costly to obtain and process information.
Carroll argues that a more appealing microfoundation of sticky information is
related to the slow dissemination of information. The author argues that households’ expectations are derived from news reports, which in turn reflect the views
of professional forecasters. The author compares the dissemination of information to the dissemination of a disease considered in epidemiological studies. Carroll finds that households only occasionally pay attention to the expectations of
professional forecasters, and this inattention generates stickyness in aggregate
expectations. Both in Carroll and MR this result is presented as a microfoundation to the sticky information model. Moreover, MR calibrate the information
absorption parameter using the estimates of Carroll. Their model is sensitive to
the calibration of this specific parameter.
MR assume that when agents revise expectations they do it rationally. Carroll
assumes that households revise expectations towards the reported expectations of
the Survey of Professional Forecasters (henceforth, SPF), which as he claims may
be rational. We show, however, that it is hard to argue that professional forecasters form expectations rationally.1 This observation breaks the link between
Carroll and MR setup. It is possible to check Carroll’s results assuming that
households revise expectations towards RE instead of the SPF mean. Carroll argues that if one would do so it is unlikely that his results would change. Roberts
(1998) had already provided an empirical framework where households are assumed to update their expectations towards RE. We reexamine Roberts (1998)
work and we provide further empirical evidence. We find that Carroll’s results
change dramatically. This evidence allows us to affirm that Carroll’s results are
hardly related to the MR setup.
Finally, one could still say that the epidemiological approach of Carroll is an
important finding in itself. It is interesting to know that households’ expectations move towards the expectations of professional forecasters. In fact, Carroll
argues that his main finding is exactly that households expectations follow the
SPF. However, we examine the households’ median forecast and find a basic and
severe inconsistency with the epidemiological approach. Overall, our results are
quite discomforting for Carroll and the link that Carroll and MR draw between
their approaches. We caution the reader that our results are significantly less
discomforting for the MR sticky information setup. MR framework can be motivated under a different microfoundation and has been estimated with different
techniques.2

The observation that the SPF and other surveys are not rational led many researchers to
question the validity of these surveys.

The paper is organized as follows: section 2 analyzes the rationality of professional forecasters, section 3 estimates the model when households update towards
RE, section 4 shows that the epidemiological view of expectations is hard to reconcile with the data, section 5 concludes.

Is the SPF inflation forecast rational?

Carroll and MR do connect their frameworks and MR use Carroll’s estimates
in their calibration. As we described in the introduction, if the expectations
reported in the SPF are not rational then Carroll and MR frameworks are not
directly related.
The Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan conducts a monthly
survey intended to be representative of the USA population. Carroll uses the
mean inflation forecast of inflation for the next year as a proxy for households’
expectations. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia conducts a quarterly
survey targeted at professional forecasters. Carroll uses the mean inflation expectations of the SPF for the next year as a proxy for RE or newspaper forecasts.
The mean Michigan and mean SPF forecast are shown in figure 1. Figure 2 shows
the SPF forecast and core inflation and figure 3 shows the SPF forecast and CPI
inflation. The Mean Square Error of the mean and median forecasts are computed
in table 1.3 The mean forecast is usually used to assess the overall forecasters’
opinion, however the mean is sensitive to outliers that may report bad forecasts
for several reasons. Some authors argue that the median forecast is more accurate
since it is less sensitive to outliers. The first column considers the forecast error
relative to core inflation and the second column considers CPI inflation. While
core inflation may relate more directly to the foreseeable component of inflation,
the CPI inflation may reflect more accurately households relevant measure of inflation. For core inflation the SPF mean performs the best but for CPI inflation
the Michigan median has the lowest mean squared error. Overall, table 1 suggest
that the relative forecast accuracy of the two surveys depends on the measure of
inflation considered.

Quarterly Data From 1981:03 To 2000:02

Even if the SPF would undoubtedly forecast better than the Michigan it would
not imply that the SPF inflation forecast is rational. Carroll brings evidence
from Croushore (1998) to argue that the SPF is indeed rational. However, in
addition to arguments that Carroll invokes, Croushore (1998) also argues that
it is possible to improve inflation forecasts and that the forecasts do not pass
all tests of rationality. Adam and Padula (2003) and Nunes (2006) also analyze
the SPF forecast concluding that the forecasts are not entirely rational. In any
case, neither Croushore nor Adam and Padula used the same measure of inflation
forecast as that used by Carroll. While Carroll considers the inflation forecast,
the previous authors consider the GDP deflator forecast.
Since previous work did not examine the SPF inflation forecast rationality we
will proceed with such examination. We will apply two basic tests of rationality
to the SPF inflation forecast for the sample period considered by Carroll. If the
SPF mean inflation forecast is rational then the average prediction error should
be zero. The average prediction error relative to core inflation is -0.271. The
null that this value is zero has a p-value of 0.001. The average prediction error
relative to CPI inflation is -1.075. The null that this value is zero has a p-value
of 0.000. This first test does not suggest that the SPF forecast is rational in the
sense that MR employ.

expected inflation rates. If the constant is equal to zero and the coefficient on
the expectation term equals one then we accept unbiasedness. For core inflation
we obtain4
πt,t+4 = 0.770 + 0.730St πt,t+4
(0.488) (0.133)

(1)

where πt,t+4 is inflation in the following four quarters and St [πt,t+4 ] is the SPF
forecast for πt,t+4 . For CPI inflation we obtain

(0.548) (0.143)

The significance level of the bias test for the first regression is 0.043 and 0
for the second one. So we soundly reject no bias. Even if a forecast passes the
previous tests, we would still have to check if all information is used efficiently
efficient. Since it hardly arguable that the SPF is rational we do not provide such
analysis here. Adam and Padula (2003) provide such analysis and conclude that
not all information is used efficiently. It has been argued in the literature that in

2.1

Should we consider Rational Expectations?

Carroll claims to have found a microfoundation of the sticky information model
of MR. Since MR assume that when households update expectations they form
RE, the previous section shows that there is a big gap between both approaches.
Based on the results of Roberts (1998), Carroll argues that if one would assume
that households’ expectations move towards rational expectations the results do
not change. However, this conjecture does not hold, Branch (2004) in a heterogeneous expectations framework obtains quite different results if he replaces VAR
generated expectations by RE.
As a first step let’s review Carroll’s results presented in table 2. The first row
estimates the equation
Mt [πt,t+4 ] = α0 + α1 St [πt,t+4 ] + α2 Mt−1 [πt−1,t+3 ] + νt ,

(3)

where St [πt,t+4 ] and Mt [πt,t+4 ] are the SPF and Michigan mean forecast respectively. The results are not extremely encouraging. We can not accept that the
model does not have a constant and neither can we accept that α1 + α2 = 1. Despite these evidence, Carroll imposes these restrictions. He finds that α1 = 0.27
6

as can be seen in table 2. If we allow for the presence of lagged inflation we
estimate
Mt [πt,t+4 ] = α0 + α1 St [πt,t+4 ] + α2 Mt−1 [πt−1,t+3 ] + α3 Pt [πt−5,t−1 ] + νt ,

(4)

where Pt [πt−5,t−1 ] represents the most recently published annual inflation rate as
of time t. Again table 2 shows that the results are not better. We reject that
the constant is zero and that α1 + α2 + α3 = 1. If we impose these restrictions
the results are still disappointing, since the implied α3 is negative.5 In spite of
the obvious limitations of these estimations both Carroll and MR argue that the
the second estimation in table 2 provides evidence in favor of sticky information.
MR calibrate the information absorption parameter with the value of α1 = 0.25,
which is statistically equal to 0.27.
We will now estimate an equation where households’ expectations move towards the rational expectations, which is the assumption that MR employ. We
will estimate
Mt [πt,t+4 ] = α0 + α1 Et [πt,t+4 ] + α2 Mt−1 [πt−1,t+3 ] + νt

(5)

where Et [πt,t+4 ] is the RE term. The previous equation can not be estimated with
OLS and we have to employ GMM instead. 6 We are considering CPI inflation,
the results do not change if we consider core inflation. The hypothesis that the
constant is zero and the weights sum to 1 is rejected. The J-test shows that the
instruments are valid. Proceeding as Carroll and imposing the restrictions we
now find that α1 = 0.097, a value dramatically below 0.27. This result is hardly
surprising, looking at figure 2 or 3 we see that the SPF overpredicts inflation,
while both variables are decreasing. Therefore, it must be that if households
move towards RE they must do it slower than towards the SPF. Table 3 also
shows that including lagged inflation does not help. Our results show that there
is a considerable difference between considering that households move towards
the SPF forecast or the RE as considered in MR. We find that the rationality
content of surveys is much lower than that shown by Roberts.9 We conjecture
that Roberts results are simply not robust to different orthogonalizations and
must be taken with caution.
5

Note that if one just uses OLS the specification where Pt [πt−5,t−1 ] may be preferable.
The reason is that if both households and professional forecasters use lagged inflation to form
expectations equation 3 has an endogeneity problem while equation 4 does not.
6
We use a four lag Newey-West covariance matrix, the results are robust to the inclusion of
additional lags. We used different sets of instruments to check for robustness.7 The instruments
used in the computations of table 3 include two lags of the Michigan Survey forecast and four
lags of quarterly unemployment and federal funds interest rate. We are not considering current
period variables to allow for publication and information delays as is standard to assume in the
literature.8
9
For the Michigan survey Roberts estimate α1 to be 0.61 using two different sets of instruments for the sample 1966:2-1995:4. Roberts (1998) uses a different orthogonalization but
nevertheless his results are quite different from 0.25.

Do households’ expectations follow Professional Forecasters’ expectations?

This section shows that the epidemiological view seems to be flawed altogether.
Carroll’s estimations only use the mean forecasts because his model is only valid
for the mean. Nevertheless, one can examine the time series behaviour of the median to check the model’s consistency. The epidemiological approach says that a
proportion (α1 ) of households update their expectations towards the SPF mean.
By examining figure 1 we can understand the results of Carroll’s estimations. In
the first half of the sample, households and SPF forecasts move quite closely. In
the second half of the subsample, the SPF forecast moves down and the households forecasts move down with some delay. It is therefore not surprising that
Carroll finds that the Michigan mean follows the SPF mean. Figure 4 plots the
Michigan median forecast and the SPF mean forecast. Figure 4 is quite surprising. It does seem strange that while the Michigan mean is above the SPF mean,
the Michigan median is below. Given Carroll’s story, it appears odd that the SPF
mean follows the Michigan median.
In addition, we also observe some basic inconsistencies in figure 4. We observe, quite frequently, in this sample that the Michigan median is falling, given
that the Michigan median is below the SPF mean. If Carroll’s model were true
this behaviour should not happen. According to Carroll, nearly 25 per cent of
8

households update their beliefs towards the SPF mean; given a distribution for
the Michigan forecasts, if the SPF mean is higher than the Michigan median, then
it can not be that the Michigan median falls. We observe that in figure 4 this
inconsistency arises quite often.10 A symmetric inconsistency emerges at the end
of the sample as the Michigan median rises while it is above the SPF mean. Another more subtle inconsistency also arises in this sample. The Michigan median
increases/decreases towards the SPF mean but it becomes higher/lower than the
SPF mean (we denote this fact as inconsistency 2). In order to spot more easily
the inconsistencies mentioned, Figure 5 plots the Michigan median and the next
period SPF mean forecast. In the bottom of the graph, we plot two series labelled
inconsistency 1 and inconsistency 2, when these series are 1 it means that an inconsistency is present and when they are 0 there is no inconsistency. The first
inconsistency arises in 48,75% of the data (80 data points) and the second arises
10%, overall 58,75% of the data is against the epidemiological model of Carroll.

Conclusion

The sticky information framework has been shown to improve the implications
of macroeconomic models. Carroll presents an epidemiological microfoundation
for sticky information models. We find that such microfoundation is flawed. We
first bring evidence to the fact that the SPF inflation mean forecast is biased and,
therefore, can not be rational in the usual sense. We also estimated an equation
where households’ expectations move towards the RE as MR argue. We find that
the results differ dramatically from those of Carroll. In addition, by inspecting the
households’ median forecast and the SPF mean forecast we manage to invalidate
the epidemiological microfoundation of sticky information models.

10

One can still argue, that households update expectations towards a distribution of forecasts
of the SPF. In this case, it is not impossible to see falling median while the SPF average is
higher since some forecasts of the SPF may be lower than the Michigan median. Our response
to this reasoning, is that it is not impossible but it is extremely unlikely to observe that this
phenomena is observed so often in the data.
