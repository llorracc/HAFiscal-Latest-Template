News on Inflation and the Epidemiology of Inflat

Expectations
This paper examines the nexus between news coverage on inflation and
households' inflation expectations. In doing so, we test the epidemiological
foundations of the sticky information model (Carroll 2003, 2006). We use
both aggregate and household-level data from the Survey Research Center
at the University of Michigan. We highlight a fundamental disconnection
among news on inflation, consumers' frequency of expectation updating,
and the accuracy of their expectations. Our evidence provides at best weak
support to the epidemiological framework, as most of the consumers who
update their expectations do not revise them toward professional forecasters'
mean forecast.

The rational expectations revolution that has swept through
the economics profession in the 1970s has shaped macroeconomic modeling ever
since. Nevertheless, rational expectations have often been criticized based on their
inadequacy to account for a realistic process of economic forecasting. In response
to this criticism, recent years have borne witness to alternative theories of expecta
tion formation, whose common trait consists of relaxing the set of strong assump
tions imposed by the rational expectations paradigm. One of such novel approaches

assumes that information is sticky and disseminates slowly throughout the population

so that economic agents revise their expectations periodically. Carroll (2003, 200
henceforth, Carroll) has put forward an epidemiological mechanism of expectat

formation, according to which consumers update their expectations from the med

which are assumed to transmit professional forecasters' projections. The resulti
framework is consistent with the intuition behind the sticky information model

Mankiw and Reis (2001, 2002).

Carroll examines inflation and unemployment forecasts collected by the Univ
sity of Michigan's Survey Research Center. He shows that households revise the
expectations toward the mean forecast from the Survey of Professional Forecaste

which he claims to be rational. The estimated absorption rate is rather low, with only

fourth (third) of the agents updating their inflation (unemployment) forecasts in eve

quarter.1 He also provides empirical support to a main implication of the model; th

is, greater news coverage induces "more rational" household forecasts. In fact, h
shows that higher dissemination of news narrows the gap between the mean forec
from the Michigan Survey and that of professional forecasters.

This paper tests the epidemiological theory of expectation formation. From a
methodological viewpoint, one of its main novelties consists of exploiting both
gregate and household-level data from the Michigan Survey. The analysis with agg
gate data primarily focuses on Carroll's corollary that more news stories imply th
people are better informed and produce better forecasts. To this end, we complem
Carroll's index of newspapers coverage with Michigan Survey data on consumers
perception of favorable and unfavorable price developments in the period before t
interview. Unlike the index of newspapers coverage employed by Carroll, which is

necessarily informative about the actual degree of receptiveness to publicly availa

information on prices, the Michigan Survey provides us with a direct measure of t
flow of news on prices that consumers have heard. Surprisingly, both available an

perceived news stories do not help at restricting the forecast gap between consume
mean forecast and that of the professional forecasters, but rather widen it. Once

account for the content of the information that disseminates throughout the popu
tion, it turns out that unfavorable news (i.e., higher prices) exerts a positive imp
on the forecast gap, while favorable news (i.e., lower prices) has either no statis

cally significant impact or weakly contributes to reducing consumers' expectati

bias. Overall, these results stand in sharp contrast with the theoretical apparatus p
forward by Carroll.

The analysis with household-level data represents the core of the study. We sho

that an average of about 75% of the respondents revise their inflation forecasts w

respect to their first interview. This figure is considerably greater than the absorpti

rate estimated by Carroll. We also show that accessing some recent information o

This result might explain the discrepancy between Carroll's model—which forma

the process of expectation updating underlying households' mean forecast—and
evidence from household-level data.

Our analysis suggests that just a small fraction of consumer forecasts can be ex
plained according to the epidemiological model. Moreover, it appears that households
do not make the best use of the information they perceive, as they persistently deviate

from professional forecasters' mean expectation, displaying no tendency to adjust
their forecasts appropriately. One possible interpretation is that news transmitted by

the media distorts consumers' expectations, as it may contain judgmental assess
ments of professional forecasters' views. As a consequence, media reports could be
biased and the epidemiological mechanism results as a channel that transmits dis
torted expectations. This factor could also explain why the degree of perception of
unfavorable news on prices is significantly higher than that of favorable news, and
why the accuracy of consumers' expectations decreases in the volume of negative
news being perceived. We believe these results should lead academics and policy
makers altogether to reconsider the role of information dissemination in stimulating
consumers' expectation updating. Most importantly, they should serve as a useful
guideline to envisage communication strategies and channels capable of ensuring
that private expectations are well anchored.
The remainder of the paper is laid out as follows. Section 1 describes the data;
Section 2 explores the nexus between expectation updating, consumers' predictive
accuracy, and news on prices; Section 3 examines household-level data from the

larger impact than declines on inflation expectations.

information on a wide range of factors that influence consumers' expectations. As
such, they allow us to explore the process of expectation updating in greater detail. In
this section, we describe the key features of the data set and report some preliminary

evidence on households' and professional forecasters' inflation expectations, as well
as on the newspapers index proposed by Carroll and a direct measure of consumers'
receptiveness toward news on prices.

1.1 Inflation Expectations
In the estimation of his model Carroll proxies household expectations with the
mean inflation forecast from the Survey of Consumer Attitudes and Behavior, which

is conducted by the Survey Research Center (SRC) at the University of Michigan.
The Michigan Survey (henceforth, MS) has been available on a monthly basis since
January 1978.3 The short rotating panel design represents its main peculiarity: 40%
of prior respondents are reinterviewed in every round, the remaining 60% being
initial interviews from a random subsample of the telephone-owning mainland U.S.
population. Two relevant questions about expected changes in the price level are
addressed to the participants: first, they are asked whether they expect prices to go
up, go down or stay the same in the next 12 months, and second, they are asked to
provide a quantitative statement about the expected change.4
As to professional forecasts, Carroll employs the mean inflation expectation from
the Survey of Professional Forecasters (henceforth, SPF). The SPF, currently con
ducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, has collected and summarized
forecasts from leading private forecasting firms since 1968. The survey questionnaire
is distributed once a quarter and asks participants for quarter-by-quarter forecasts,
spanning the current and next five quarters.5

The present study explores both aggregate and household-level data from the

MS. The analysis at the aggregate level (Section 2) relies on quarterly data over
the 1978Q1-2011Q2 time window, while Section 3 reports evidence based on
MS monthly microdata data over the 1978M1-2011M2 period.6 In the analy
sis at the aggregate level we take the MS and SPF mean forecasts as indicators
of central tendency in inflation forecasting, so as to be coherent with Carroll's
3. Over the time window we examine the survey covers a monthly average of 575 households, with a
peak of 1,479 respondents in 1978M11 and a minimum of 492 in 1992M11. A monthly average of about
500 respondents has been interviewed since 1987M1.
4. If a respondent expects prices to stay the same, the interviewer must make sure she does not actually
expect that prices will change at the same rate they have changed in the past 12 months.

5. The SPF was previously carried out as a joint product of the National Bureau of Economic Research
(NBER) and the American Statistical Association (ASA) on a wide variety of economic variables, including
GDP growth, various measures of inflation, and the rate of unemployment. For a comprehensive analysis
of the SPF forecasts, the interested reader should refer to Croushore (1998).

6. SPF forecasts of consumer price index (CPI) inflation are only available from 1981Q3. Therefore,
from 1978Q1 to 1981Q3 we proxy the SPF mean forecast of CPI inflation with the mean forecast of the
GDP deflator. The two series are highly correlated. However, for robustness purposes and to exclude the
disinflation in the first part of the sample and the ongoing period of financial and macroeconomic turmoil,
we replicate the entire analysis on the 1984-2004 subsample. The results, reported in an extended working
paper version of the present manuscript, are virtually unchanged (see Pfajfar and Santoro 2012).

framework.7'8 Figure 1 reports household and professional mean forecasts against
CPI inflation.9 Both surveys underpredict rising inflation in the first part of the sam
ple, though their predictive accuracy improves remarkably during the subsequent
disinflation. This is probably due to the credibility the Federal Reserve had acquired

in the early 1980s, when the Federal Reserve System was headed by Paul Vol
cker. From 1984 onward, expectations appear reasonably anchored, although they
often fail to match periods of low inflation and, most notably, the 2009Q1-2009Q3
deflation.

7. One could argue that the median is less sensitive to outliers. In fact, cross-sectional variation in
consumers' forecasts is substantial, with some implausible responses. Moreover, Thomas (1999) shows
the median of the MS to be a better forecast than its mean. Nevertheless, Carroll's framework delivers
predictions only for the mean and not for the median. For robustness purposes, in Pfajfar and Santoro
(2012) we replicate the analysis at the aggregate level using the median forecasts from the MS and the
SPF. We observe negligible (quantitative) differences with respect to the results reported in the present

manuscript.

8. Given the presence of some implausible responses it is advisable to exclude outliers. Curtin (1996)
shows that alternative truncation rules lead to nearly unchanged results. In the analysis of household-level
data we opt for a truncation at —5% and +30%: this yields 228,837 interviews over the 1978M1-2011M2
period.

9. Inflation expectations carried out at time t are graphed at the realized date (i.e., t + 4), so as to

enhance comparability with the forecast target.

1.2 News on Inflation
A direct implication of Carroll's view is that more news stories should imply

that people are better informed and produce better forecasts. He proposes a formal
statistical test of whether greater news coverage is associated with "more rational"

household forecasts. The econometric model employed to test this hypothesis is at th

core of our analysis and requires reliable indicators of the flow of news on inflatio

the public is confronted with. Carroll computes a yearly index of the intensity o

news coverage in the New York Times and the Washington Post. We compute a simila

index for each newspaper and each quarter since 1980Q1 (i.e., the year and quarter
that both newspapers have been included in the LexisNexis database), searching fo
stories that contain words beginning with the root "inflation" (so that also words
like "inflationary" or "inflation-fighting" can be detected). For each newspaper, the
number of stories is then converted to an index by dividing the number of articles i
a given quarter by the total number of articles in the same quarter.10

Our analysis will partly rely on a measure of consumers' perception of new in
formation about prices. This has to be intended as a complement to the newspapers

index proposed by Carroll. In fact, the accuracy of a proxy based on the intensity of
news coverage on national newspapers can be questioned on different grounds. Fo
instance, Blinder and Krueger (2004) suggest that consumers primarily rely on infor
mation about inflation from the TV, followed by local and national newspapers.11 It i
also plausible to expect that the volume of news about inflation does not necessarily
match the flow of information that is assimilated by the public. In this respect,
nontrivial discrepancy could result from the interplay of two mutually reinforcing
effects: (i) news from the media do not necessarily reach the public uniformly and
(ii) the connection between news and inflation expectations is likely to be affected by
consumers' receptiveness to this news and the capacity to process new information.
Indeed, Sims (2003) emphasizes the presence of information-processing constraint
that could be compatible with such inefficiencies. In light of these considerations, it
is advisable to complement the analysis with a variable that accounts for consumers
actual perception of the information reported in the media. Household-level data from

the MS allow us to compute a measure of the fraction of respondents that have heard
of recent changes in prices. Information about the content of this news is also avai

able, with the survey participants indicating whether they have heard about positive or

negative changes. Specifically, the following question is addressed to each household

"During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable change

10. A potential problem connected with this type of search is that the resulting index may include
articles that do not primarily cover U.S. inflation. Thus, we test the robustness of this methodology by
restricting the search to articles that just cover U.S. inflation. Moreover, we exclude articles with less than
120 words, so as to rule out short comments and summaries, searching for words beginning with the root
"inflation" that are located either in the headline or among the "index terms." The resulting index yields
empirical evidence in line with the results we report in the present article.
11. We should also consider that over the last decade the Internet has become a main source of news

on various economic statistics.

in business conditions?"12 In case of an affirmative response, a second question is
asked: "What did you hear?" To address this query, the respondent is presented with
a number of options regarding the type of business conditions she might have heard
about, such as government, unemployment, prices, consumer demand, stock market,
credit, and trade deficit. She is allowed to name at most two of these options. Should
prices be one of the selected options, she can reply either (i) "Favorable News: Lower
Prices" or (ii) "Unfavorable News: Higher Prices."13,14
Figure 2 reports the fraction of MS respondents that have heard news about prices,

together with the newspapers index and CPI inflation. The two news-related series
display poor correlation. Moreover, the newspapers index displays weaker comove
ment with the rate of inflation, as compared to our measure of "perceived news."

12. Consumer sentiment indices as those that can be derived from household-level data on the per
ception of business conditions have been successfully employed in various studies (see, among others,
Souleles 2004).
13. Should the interviewer perceive that the respondent has an uncorrect understanding of the question
on perceived changes in prices, a further question is asked that aims at making sure that the responses
"Favorable News: Lower Prices" and "Unfavorable News: Higher Prices" are correctly interpreted.

14. The MS respondents primarily report about news on unemployment, followed by news on the

government (elections) and then prices. It is important to stress that 41% of the respondents report having
heard no news at all and that in 28% of the cases only one option is reported. This is to say that, on average,

only 31% of the respondents are confronted with a potentially binding limit of two options. Therefore,
though some underreporting may affect our measure of perceived changes in prices, this is not likely to be
primarily induced by the specific design of the questionnaire.

The latter is more volatile, especially when abrupt changes in the rate of inflation
occur, though in the last part of the sample it displays sizable fluctuations that neither

actual inflation nor the newspapers index present. This probably reflects higher un
certainty characterizing consumers' information during the recent period of marked
macroeconomic and financial turmoil.

When looking at the perceived tone of the news consumers have heard
(Figure 3), it can be noted that the fraction of consumers that report favorable news
almost constantly lie below the fraction of those that report unfavorable news. The

latter proportion of respondents is more volatile and tends to peak when inflation
accelerates. As expected on a priori grounds, the percentage of agents reporting
favorable news is negatively (yet weakly) correlated with the rate of inflation. The
sign of this correlation is reversed when considering the fraction of respondents that
have heard negative news, indicating that households pay attention to news cover
age mostly during adverse periods, which are characterized by relatively higher and
more volatile inflation.15 This type of asymmetry is in line with the prospect the
ory pioneered by Kahneman and Tversky (1979), as agents tend to manifest higher

15. In the last part of the sample, higher volatility in the measure of (perceived) unfavorable news is
not coupled with higher volatility in the rate of inflation. Such a delinking in the behavior of the two series
probably reflects the emergence of additional determinants of consumers' receptiveness toward news about

inflation, as well as the substantial increase in the volume of economic reporting on different aspects of
the ongoing financial and macroeconomic turmoil.

receptiveness toward bad news on prices, as compared to good news. According
Hamilton (2004) and Soroka (2006), a common finding in literature on news cover

is that there is more reporting of bad news than good news. To explain this evide

Lamia and Lein (2008) suggest that newspapers may have an incentive to favor
news over good news, so as to catch more attention from the readers and incr
their sales.

2. NEWS AND EXPECTATION UPDATING: EVIDENCE FROM AGGREGATE
DATA

According to the epidemiological foundations of the sticky information model,
consumers update their forecasts from news reports, which are influenced by the ex
pectations of the professional forecasters.16 The key assumption is that news spreads
slowly across agents, reaching only a fraction of the population in each period. Carroll

examines his model's ability to explain the MS data by estimating an equation of the
form

Jlf+4]t = Oil 7T,+4|, + «2^+311-1 + V„ (1)
where nf+A\t denotes the time t mean MS forecast of inflation at time t + 4, while
7TtF+41, is the SPF mean expectation over the same forecast horizon. We estimate (1)
by ordinary least squares (OLS) and report the estimation results in Table 1. Overall
our evidence is qualitatively in line with Carroll, as the rate of absorption we estimate

implies that about a fourth of the MS participants update their forecasts in every
quarter. An important difference with the benchmark study is that the proposition
u\ T o?2 — 1 can be rejected at standard levels of statistical confidence. Thus, we

reject the key model's prediction that households' mean expectation should result
as a simple weighted average of the current "rational" (or newspaper) forecast and
last period's mean inflation expectation.17 We also expand the set of regressors in
equation (1) with the most recently published annual inflation rate as of time t. As in
Carroll, the past inflation rate exerts a negative impact, though its coefficient is not
statistically significant. Finally, the constant term is usually not significant or barely

significant, implying that expectation updating through local or global interaction
should not be an issue of concern.18

16. Mankiw and Reis (2001, 2002) envisage a similar framework. They assume that agents update
their forecasts only occasionally, due to the presence of an explicit cost to obtain and process information.

17. Nunes (2009) reports similar evidence.

18. Carroll (2006) explores the idea that individuals update their forecasts through informal com
munication networks, demonstrating that a significant constant term in the epidemiological model could
reflect social transmission of inflation expectations via conversations with neighbors (in addition to the
news media channel). Carroll's exercise assumes that households who do not encounter the news source
still face some probability of having an informal conversation about inflation (with a randomly selected
other person in the population). For robustness purposes, we estimate alternative models of expectation
updating whose common assumption is that "informed" consumers (i.e., individuals who report hearing

The results so far are somewhat supportive of the epidemiological process of
expectation formation. However, an indirect test of the model's ability to fit the
data can be envisaged by comparing the estimates of oq in equation (1) with the
degree of receptiveness to news displayed by the MS participants. In this respect,
survey data reflect a higher degree of information stickiness, as compared to the
indirect measure of updating frequency obtained by Carroll. On average, only 5.8%

of the interviewees report having heard news about prices in each quarter. Such a
discrepancy emphasizes the need to distinguish between "available" and "perceived"
news for a reliable assessment of the relationship between news coverage of inflation,
staggered updating of expectations, and consumers' predictive accuracy. To this

end, we examine the corollary that greater news coverage should be associated
with "more rational" household forecasts. As a formal procedure to test for this,

GAP, =y0 + y¡NEWS? + yiNEWSf + y3 (NEWS? x NEWS?) + ¡x,,
GAP, = {GAPSQ,, GAPSQ*},
where NEWS? is the fraction of MS respondents that have heard news about prices.
As exposed above, we interpret this measure as an explicit indicator of the actual
flow of information assimilated by the public, as compared to the newspapers index
employed by Carroll.19 To test the robustness of our results we also consider an
alternative measure of expectation bias, which depends on the distance between
the time t MS mean forecast of inflation at time t + 4 and CPI inflation at time
t + 4: GAPSQ* — (jrf+4— tx,+a)2. In fact, GAPSQ does not account for the fact that
professional forecasters may not form expectations rationally, as a number of studies

indicate (e.g., Roberts 1998, Lanne, Louma and Luoto 2009, Nunes 2009).
Surprisingly, estimating (3) and various alternative specifications points to a pos
itive and statistically significant relationship between the expectation gap and either
measure of the flow of news on inflation (see Table 2).20 Therefore, a rise in the

19. Note that NEWSf proxies the amount of news heard before the inflation forecast is carried out.
This allows us to avoid the impact of reverse causation.

20. Importantly, we reach the same conclusions by regressing the expectation gap over a constant
and the newspapers index. These results are not overturned if we consider the time window examined by
Carroll (additional results are available upon request from the authors). By contrast, it should be noted that
Carroll's estimates are not robust in this sense, as he shows that excluding the first year of the SPF mean
forecast from the sample may affect the statistical significance of the estimated impact of news on the
expectation gap. It should also be noted that Carroll uses a yearly index in regressions involving quarterly
data. Our estimates do not suffer from this type of inconsistency, as we compute a quarterly newspapers

index.

fraction of "informed" consumers increases the distance between the MS and SPF

mean forecasts, a result that stands in sharp contrast to Carroll. When accounting for

the joint effect of NEWSf and NEWS?, only the former exerts a positive impact on
the expectation gap, while the coefficient attached to NEWS? is either not statistically
different from zero or barely significant. Finally, we search for the presence of inter

action effects between newspapers' coverage and households' receptiveness toward
news about inflation, allowing for the term NEWSf x NEWS'? in the set of regres
sors. The additional regressor explains most of the variability in GAPSQ,, though its
coefficient is only significant at the 10% level. As to NEWS? and NEWS?, they both
exert a negative impact, though their coefficients are not statistically different from

zero.21 This comes as no surprise, given that both measures of news present posi
tive correlations with GAPSQ,. Nevertheless it should be noted that perceived news
presents greater correlation with both measures of prediction bias and dominates their
correlations with the interaction term.22

We now focus on a second dimension of the relationship between news on inflation

and expectation updating, which consists of accounting for the perceived content of
the news consumers have heard of. Doms and Morin (2004) show that media coverage
is important in that it affects households' perception of the economy in at least three

ways. First, media affect sentiment by informing consumers about economic data and

professional opinions. Second, the greater the volume of news about the economy,
the greater the likelihood that consumers update their expectations. These channels
are explicitly at work in Carroll's framework. However, Doms and Morin point to a
third channel that the epidemiological model disregards, suggesting that consumers
receive a signal about the economy through the tone of economic reporting.23 The next

exercise aims at disentangling the differential impact that favorable and unfavorable

news on prices may exert on the distance between MS and SPF mean forecasts. The
following equation is estimated:

GAP, = Yo + y[j'NEWS?u + Y\NEWS?'f + n,. (4)
Table 3 shows that while favorable news exerts a negative—yet not statistically
significant—impact on the expectation gap, unfavorable news tends to enlarge it.
Thus, we cannot appreciate a negative impact of news on the expectation gap even
when consumers' overall perception is more pessimistic and their forecasts should
reflect higher accuracy and/or attentiveness to economic reporting. Also Lamia and
Lein (2008) report similar evidence based on German data on inflation expectations,

21. When assuming GAPSQ' as the dependent variable, the interaction term has no statistically signif
icant impact, while NEWS* exerts a stronger positive impact than NEWSf, whose effect is only significant
at the 10% level.

22. Table Al in the Appendix reports pairwise correlations among the variables employed in the
regression analysis of Section 2. The correlation between GAPSQ, and NEWSf (NEWS") is about 60%
(24%). Otherwise, Corx(NEWS^, GAPSQ') is about 57 %, while Corr(N£WS;v, GAPSQ') is not statistically

different from zero.

23. According to Sims (2003), rational inattention provides an explanation why the tone and volume
of economic reporting affect sentiment beyond the economic information contained in the reporting.

perceived inflation in Sweden. These facts certainly deserve to be examined in further

detail. The next section investigates these issues with the support of household-level
data.

3. NEWS AND EXPECTATION UPDATING: EVIDENCE FROM
HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL DATA

The MS household-level data provide us with a further opportunity to test

microfoundation of the sticky information model. To this end, we examine

between individual-specific information on prices and expectation updating.

forecasts in the second interview: Figure 4 reports the resulting time-vary
quency of expectation updating, together with CPI inflation. The two serie

average, expectation updating takes place at a faster pace when inflation is h

more volatile, as in the first part of the sample. Notably, the time-varying f

reaches its maximum only in two episodes, namely, March 1980 (i.e., the
peak in the rate of inflation) and November 1989.24

On average, 74.9% of the respondents do update their inflation forecast

greater than the proportion of those who have perceived news about inflation, as well

as than the absorption rate estimated by Carroll. Deeper insights come from inspect
ing the direction of expectation updating. We compare the fraction of respondents that

revise their expectations toward the SPF mean forecast with those who move further

away. Interestingly, households split evenly into these categories, with 51.3% of the
participants revising expectations in the "right" direction. In addition, only for 16.2%

of the consumers who revise their forecasts we cannot reject the null hypothesis
according to which their expectations match exactly the SPF mean expectation. The
picture remains virtually unchanged even if we just consider "informed" households:
in this case, the percentage of those who update expectations toward the SPF bench
mark is 49.4%.26 We also compute the average forecast error for those who update
their expectations and those who do not, as well as for the households that report
some recent news on prices and those who do not (see Table 4). Surprisingly, the
average forecast error is about 12% higher when consumers update their forecasts,
regardless of whether they are aware of some recent changes in prices. Table 4 also

26. We also consider expectation updating "toward" the CPI rate of inflation. In this case 50.5% of the
MS interviewees that update their forecasts do revise them in the "right" direction. This figure reduces
to 49% when we consider agents that have heard of recent changes in prices, though this percentage is
statistically lower than 50% only at the 10% level of statistical significance.

implies that the average forecast error is significantly higher when consumers report

of recent changes in prices, as compared to when they do not.

The key message we retrieve from the preliminary investigation of household
level statistics is that having some information at hand does not necessarily reflect
into more accurate forecasts. Armed with this preliminary evidence, a main task of

our analysis is to examine in closer detail the interconnection between the degree
of receptiveness to news about inflation and the probability that households revise

their expectations. We specify a binary response model of the process underlying
expectation updating at the household level. The following variable is defined:

Í1 ifz*>0
z, = ,

[O if z* < 0

i

=

l,2,...,

N,

(5)

where z* is the latent variable that accounts for consumers' expectation updating. Its

discrete counterpart, z, , takes value 1 if the ith respondent has updated her expec
tations from the first interview, and 0 otherwise. Since individuals are interviewed
only twice, the only reference term to determine whether expectation updating has
taken place is represented by the response in the second interview. Thus, we avoid
reporting time-subscripts. The following latent process is assumed:

z* = a + NEWS? P + NEWS" p + jtS + :xF û + \¡y + u¡, (6)
where a is a constant, NEWSf is an individual-specific indicator of news percep

0 otherwise), NEWSN indexes the intensity of news coverage, it denotes the last
observed CPI inflation rate,27 nF is the mean forecast from the SPF, x, is a vector

such as the average rate of inflation over the 6-month reinterview period. However, we obtain neither
qualitatively nor quantitatively different results.

survey respondents are reinterviewed. Moreover, though the SRC tries to ensure that

first interviews are a random subsample of the population, not all respondents who
are selected for a second interview agree to participate. We label the resulting drop
off as "interview attrition." It is also possible to identify a fraction of respondents that

participate in the second interview but do not provide a year-ahead inflation expecta
tion. This type of drop off is usually referred to as "question attrition." Although this

amounts to 6.8% of the total number of survey respondents over the time window
we examine, it may represent a potential source of bias. To account for this factor,

we implement the Heckman correction (Heckman 1979), a procedure that offers a
means of correcting for nonrandomly selected samples.28

The binary response framework provides some support to the sticky information
paradigm. As shown in Table 5, hearing news on prices on average increases the prob
ability that households revise their inflation forecasts, no matter which news-related

variable is considered.29 However, when both NEWSf and NEWSn are accounted

for in the set of regressors, only the former is found to exert a statistically signifi

cant positive effect. Finally, both current inflation and the SPF mean forecast have a

positive impact, though the latter seems to induce a stronger marginal effect on the
probability of revising expectations.

The analysis of household-level data also confirms that an increase in the volume

of (available or perceived) news expands the gap between household forecasts and
the SPF mean expectation, as indicated by the impact of NEWS'-, in the following

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS

This paper has extensively tested the epidemiological foundations of the st
information model. We provide at best weak support for the view according to

consumers update their forecasts from the media, which are assumed to tran

professional forecasters' projections. An average of about 75% of the survey re

dents update their inflation forecasts with respect to their first interview. How

just a small fraction of those who update their forecasts (16.2%) potentially r
them in accordance with the epidemiological model. Moreover, in each quarter

5.8% of the households display some receptiveness to news on prices. This sug
a fundamental disconnection between news on inflation and consumers' expecta
updating.
A key result is that hearing news on prices does not necessarily help at producing
better forecasts, though it increases the probability that consumers revise their expec

tations. Consumers' expectation updating is also characterized by a marked degree
of pessimism, which shows at different stages of the analysis. Importantly, the rate
of CPI inflation and households' receptiveness to unfavorable news on prices exert a

positive effect on the expectation gap between households' and professional forecast

ers' mean expectations. These factors also increase the likelihood that households
persistently produce higher forecasts than professional forecasters' mean expecta
tion. Along with households' pessimistic attitude, two alternative interpretations may
be put forward to explain why consumers display stronger perception of unfavorable

rather than favorable news on prices, and why this news exerts a negative impact
on the accuracy of their forecasts. On one hand, news coverage may be biased by
the views of players in the media, so that the views of professional forecasters are
not reported objectively. On the other hand, as discussed by a number of contrib
utors, professional forecasters often produce biased projections and, even if their
views are objectively transmitted by the media, they may induce further distortions in

consumers' forecasts. These considerations altogether point to the epidemiological
mechanism of expectation formation as a transmission channel of potentially biased
forecasts. In addition, the existence of a substantial fraction of consumers who do
not adjust their forecasts toward professional forecasters' mean expectation is likely
to induce an omitted-variable bias in Carroll's estimates of the absorption rate.
Our study has some relevant implications for evaluating the cost of disinflations
and the role of communication and credibility in monetary policymaking. As to the
first aspect, a number of authors stress the importance of quantifying the cost of
disinflations in contexts where expectations are updated in a staggered fashion (see,

e.g., Mankiw and Reis 2001, 2002, Carroll 2003, 2006). Time-varying measures of
the frequency of expectation updating as the one we retrieve from household-level

data can be used to explore these issues. In fact, in agreement with the rational
inattention argument that consumers should be more intensely focused on news

on inflation and inflation-fighting policies during periods of high inflation, we show

that consumers' frequency of expectation updating has actually reached its maximum
right before Volcker's disinflationary policy kicked in during the 1980s. As to the role

of communication in policymaking, Carroll suggests that credibility among experts

may not be sufficient to achieve a desired inflationary outcome and suggests that th

views of the experts need to be communicated effectively to the population to becom
effective. These may certainly be important aspects, provided that the experts produce

efficient forecasts and these are objectively transmitted by the media. Nevertheless,

we should also account for the possibility that consumers do not necessarily follow

experts' views or they may not make an efficient use of the information they retrieve
from the media.
