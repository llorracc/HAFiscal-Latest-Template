An Epidemic Model of Investor Behavior
Sophie Shive*

Abstract
I test whether social influence affects individual investors' trading and stock returns. In
each of the 20 most active stocks in Finland over 9 years, the number of owners in a
municipality multiplied by the number of investors who do not own a stock, a measure of
the rate of transmission of diseases and rumors through social contact, predicts individual
investor trading. I control for known determinants of trade, including daily news, and show
that competing explanations for the relation are unlikely. Socially motivated trades predict
stock returns, and the effects are not reversed, suggesting that individuals share useful
information. Individuals' susceptibility to social influence has declined during the period,
but the opportunities for social influence have increased.

I. Introduction
Financial models commonly treat investors as independent agents. These
agents trade to smooth consumption, rebalance their portfolios, or exploit pri
vate information. In contrast, recent empirical work has found that investors trade
far more than these models would predict. Odean (1999) attributes the excessive
trading to an incorrectly perceived information advantage. If individuals act inde
pendently, these frequent, suboptimal trades may well wash out without affecting
prices, but there is growing evidence that individual actions are related.

Shiller ((1989), p. 7) writes: "Investing in speculative assets is a social
activity. Investors spend a substantial part of their leisure time discussing in
vestments, reading about investments, or gossiping about others' successes or
failures in investing. It is thus plausible that investors' behavior (and hence prices

of speculative assets) would be influenced by social movements." Sorescu and

Subrahmanyam (2006) provide evidence that investors focus on the content of an
alyst recommendations and do not much consider the skill of the person making
them, which suggests that they may also be open to peer influence. In this study,
I examine whether social influence can account for a portion of individual trades
and whether these trades can affect returns.
The first contribution of this paper is to introduce a new model of the deter

minants of trade that includes a measure of trades caused by social influence. The
measure of socially motivated trades is based on the empirical epidemic literature,
which has a long, successful history in modeling the infection rate of diseases,

e-mail viruses, and rumors. An epidemic setup models the rate of new occur
rences as proportional to the number of infected agents in a population multiplied
by the number of susceptible agents. In this model, the social influence factor is
the number of active investors who own the stock and who thus have a generally
positive opinion about its prospects, multiplied by the number of active investors
who do not own the stock and who therefore have either no opinion or a nega
tive one. The factor measures the likelihood that two people of different opinions
about the stock will meet and one person will influence the other, and the coef
ficient on the factor thus measures the sensitivity of individual investor trades to
social influence.

Unlike spatial correlation of trades, which is used to measure social influ
ence in extant studies, this measure is not subject to the critique that plagues the
empirical literature on social influence. Manski (1993) points out that there can
be many alternative causes of spatially correlated behavior (e.g., news and local
characteristics). By using a measure that exists prior to trading on each day, I
avoid this endogeneity problem.
The second contribution of this study is to show, in a data set of virtually
all daily trades in Finland from 1995 to 2003, that the social influence factor is a
strongly significant predictor of individual investor trades in each of the 20 high
est volume stocks. These stocks make up over 58% of the market capitalization
of Finnish equities. The significance remains after controlling for municipality
level education and income, recent return, news articles, and recent volume. The

result is robust to alternative specifications and control variables, and to tests of
alternative explanations including unobserved municipality-level characteristics,
tax-loss trading, employee trading, other forms of news besides national newspa
pers, and local brokers.

The social influence factor is also economically significant. A 10% increase
in the social influence factor is associated with a 20% increase in the number of
individual investor buys and sells. I also show that individuals' susceptibility to
social influence, which is partly explained by municipality-level characteristics,
has declined during the sample period, but the factor itself has been generally

increasing.
Last, I show that social influence-motivated trading predicts stock returns
in an economically significant way. The estimate of social trading is not calcu
lated with price data, yet it explains contemporaneous and future stock returns,
independently of past returns and the number of buy and sell transactions.

My work is related to recent theoretical literature that suggests several ways
in which investment decisions can spread socially. One well-known example is

Shive 171
the informational cascades of Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992) and
Banerjee (1992), where agents who have imperfect information optimally give
some weight to prior agents' decisions.1 Costly information, or concerns about
neighbors' relative wealth, as in Horst and Scheinkman (2006), may also motivate
imitation. Finally, Shiller (1995) states that investors may simply be drawn to
imitate others. In sum, trades that are caused by social influence may be based on
little or no new information about the firm.

Several empirical studies examine how social influence affects various as
pects of investing. Hong, Kubik, and Stein (2004) and Brown, Ivkovic, Smith,
and Weisbenner (2008) find that the decision to participate in the equity market
depends on the decisions of others in the investor's social network. The former
study also finds that households that report more participation in social activities
are also more likely to participate in the market.
The literature also explores whether social interaction affects portfolio choice.
Ivkovic and Weisbenner (2007) find that investors are more likely to purchase
stocks from a particular industry if other investors in their zip code purchase
stocks from that industry. Hong, Kubik, and Stein (2005) show that mutual fund
managers' holdings are similar to those of other managers in the same city, and
they suggest that "the evidence can be interpreted in terms of an epidemic model
in which investors spread information about stocks to one another via word of

mouth." Feng and Seasholes (2004) provide evidence that trades in a particu
lar province in the People's Republic of China are more correlated internally
than they are with trades placed in a second province. In Finland, Grinblatt,
Keloharju, and Ik?heimo (2008) show that neighbors influence automobile pur
chase decisions, which suggests that they may influence portfolio decisions as

well.

This study is the first to show that social interaction affects not only daily
trades, but also returns. Due to the richness of the data, it is the first to be able to

control for some crucial determinants of trade (e.g., daily news) and to examine
the two components of the effect of social interaction on trading: the opportunities
for social influence in the environment and the propensity of traders to be influ

enced, given a level of opportunity. Using the measures presented in this paper,
one can calculate the amount of social trading in a stock and predict returns from

these trades. This can facilitate the implementation of policies to dampen social
contagion and its effect on prices.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section I presents an overview of the data and
initial evidence of social influence on individual investors' transactions. Section II
presents the empirical model and the intuition behind it. Section III estimates the
model, Section IV presents robustness checks, Section V investigates alternative
explanations of the results, Section VI examines the determinants and time series
of social influence, and the last section concludes.

Although Avery and Zemsky (1998) show that cascades do not form when prices are endogenous
and there is only one dimension of uncertainty, it is plausible to assume that there are several dimen
sions of uncertainty in financial markets. Their example of two dimensions is i) the presence of and
ii) the effect of a shock.

II. The Model
A. Modeling Social Trades
The objective of this study is to examine to what extent social interaction
influences individual trades. To measure social trading, I use a variable inspired
by the epidemic literature, which dates back at least to Daniel Bernoulli in his

18th century description of smallpox and was expanded on by Kermack and
McKendrick (1927). Today, these models are used to describe diseases and the
spread of rumors. Epidemic models have in common that the rate at which new
infections occur is proportional to the number of infected people multiplied by the
number of susceptible people in the population. Now a ubiquitous measure of the

rate of transmission through social contact, epidemic models are loosely related
to the models of product adoption used in marketing and to hazard models.2
The intuition behind the model is that people who have strong opinions about
a stock are likely to take a position in the stock and share the opinion with oth
ers. The model of social interactions is inspired by the workhorse "SIR" model
of epidemiology. The name SIR, or susceptible-infective-recovered/removed, re
flects the 3 states that individuals in the population can find themselves in. This
model considers a population of 5?j}? (susceptible) investors in municipality i who
do not own asset j at time t, and Iij)t (infective) investors who do own the asset.
It is more likely that an investor interacts with someone from her own munic

ipality than from another. In epidemiology, the infection (here, buying) rate is
proportional to the number of infected investors (stock owners) the number of
susceptible investors (nonowners) of each stock j in each municipality i and day
t, Sijit * //,_/> I call this proportionality constant ?j^social, where b represents

buys.

Note that the variable S I is multiplicative. This is meant to capture the
fact that adding one infected person to a population allows her to potentially meet

and infect each susceptible person, so that the infection rate is multiplicative in
the sizes of the infected (/) and susceptible (S) groups, and proportional to S /.
The multiplicative nature of the epidemic model leads to differing behavior
among municipalities with the same proportion of infected if they have different

sized populations. The more people there are in the municipality, the more con
tacts can happen between these people and the higher the infection rate, because
each susceptible person is liable to meet many infected people. In a group of 100,
each of 10 infected people has the potential to meet the 90 susceptible people, and
at each meeting to infect each with some probability ?, so the expected number of
new infections will be 900/5, or 9? per person. In a group of 10, one infected per
son can potentially meet only 9 others and infect them with some probability ?, so

the expected number of new infections will be only ?, or 0.9? per person. Here,
? takes into account not only the probability of infection if a meeting occurs,
but also the probability that a meeting takes place. Thus, this structure assumes

2Given the volume of literature about this model, I do not review it here. For a synopsis of
older work, see Mollison (1995). More recent work by U.S.-based authors can be found at www

that people living in areas with high populations will converse with more peo
ple on a given day than those living in areas with small populations. One could
also assume that people have contact with the same number of other people no
matter how populated the area is in which they reside. This case is discussed in

Section IV.

Since there will be other municipality-level variables in the model, to avoid
collinearity I divide both sides by the total number of investors in the region and

proceed to model daily trades per investor for each stock.

Social_Sells_PerJnvestor/J;i

Henceforth, Slij^^/INVESTORS,-,?j?t will be shortened to SI_pi? -jf. Furthermore,
when a variable is averaged, I remove the corresponding subscript. For example,

Sj * Ij is Sij * Iij averaged over all /.

B. Controls for Alternative Determinants of Trade
Clearly, the model must incorporate characteristics of financial markets that
are not present in typical epidemic models. Many characteristics of populations
and markets can affect individuals' buying rate of a particular stock j. This section
describes the variables, and details on the empirical construction of these variables
appear in the following section.
News tends to cause investors to react together, which could possibly be mis
taken for social-interaction-based trading if not included in the model. Barber and

Odean (2008) show that news about a stock encourages individual investors to
trade it. Frieder and Subrahmanyam (2005) find that investors tend to trade stocks
with brand names that they recognize and possibly have seen in news and adver
tisements. Finnish newspaper circulation is the third highest in the world after
Norway and Japan, and 87% of the population over age 12 reads the newspaper
every day, according to Virtual Finland (http://www.virtualfinland.fi/), a Web site

containing statistics about Finland. I expect NEWS/^, a measure of recent news
about stock j, to positively influence both buys and sells, due to attention and the
process trading that incorporates information into price.
Another potential determinant of trading frequency is the past weeks' return

on the stock (LRETURN^), which has been shown by Bange (2000), Griffin,
Nardari, and Stulz (2007), and Barber and Odean (2008) to be a predictor of trad
ing behavior. This effect may manifest itself as the buying or selling by individ
ual investors. The well-known disposition effect (see, e.g., Shefrin and Statman

(1985), Odean (1998), and Shumway and Wu (2009)) predicts that individuals
will tend to sell their winning stocks and hold onto their losers, in which case one
would expect the sign on lagged returns to be positive for sales.

High volume can also attract attention, and the highest volume stocks are
often published in the Finnish newspapers in a special list. LVOLUMEy^ is the
previous day's trading volume in the stock and is meant to control for the attention

that high volume attracts. Individual trading may also be related to INCOME/.
There is no predicted sign on INCOME, as more investor sophistication might
not necessarily lead to additional trades.
Last, I control for the percentage of investors in the municipality who own
the stock (NHOLDPI/jjf). This is important especially for the model of sells,

because short selling is almost nonexistent in Finland, according to Bris,
Goetzmann, and Zhu (2004), and thus only owners can sell stock.

C. The Full Model
The social variable and the control variables can be combined into a model
of daily investor trades in each municipality / for each stock / at each day t.

Total_Buys_Per_Investor ? ;-r = /^>,social(SI-P?/jv//j,?)

+ ^owners (NHOLDPI/, ?,) + #anews(NEWS7-r) + /^^lr(LRETURN7- ,)

+ ?>,popdens (POPDENS/).
The first hypothesis to test is whether /37,?,,social> the social buying param
eter, and /^social, the social selling parameter, are positive and significant in
predicting buys and sells, once one has controlled for the other variables. These
coefficients will capture some but not all social interactions, because many social
interactions may happen across municipalities, in which case they are not picked
up by SI_pi? J r If there are no trades due to social interaction, there is no reason
why these social variables should be significant. Note that since the trades are a

per-investor measure, they are unrelated to the population size of a municipal
ity. Since they evolve over time, they are unlikely to be entirely related to stable
municipality-level characteristics.

III. Data and Estimation
A. Trading and Security Data

1. Overview
This study uses a data set containing all equity trades in Finland from the
period December 1994-January 2004. The data are held by the Finnish Central
Securities Depository (FCSD) and include 97% of the total market capitalization
of Finnish stocks. The register reports the trades of all investors, both retail and
institutional. The data also include very detailed individual investor characteristics
that are not available elsewhere, including postal code, age, sex, identification
number of the investor, and details of the trade. A thorough description of an
earlier and shorter version of this data set can be found in Grinblatt and Keloharju

(2000).

The Finnish stock market resembles the U.S. market in many ways. For ex
ample, a recent survey by the Finnish Foundation for Share Promotion reveals
that the average individual stock equity investor in Finland holds only 3.6 stocks,

which is close to the 4 stocks held by the average U.S. individual investor.3
I focus on individuals because they live in only one municipality, unlike insti
tutions, which can have branches in several municipalities.
While this data set only records direct share holdings and not indirect hold
ings through mutual funds, mutual funds were rare in Finland during this time
period. According to the Helsinki Exchange's 1997 Mutual Fund Report, there
were only 42,139 equity mutual fund accounts open in Finland at the end of 1997.
Even if each of these accounts belongs to a separate individual, this is quite small
compared to the over one million individual investors in this data set.

Of the 62,946,476 total observations in the data set, 56,261,530 involve
exchange-traded stocks and 18,180,860 (32%) of these are noncanceled trades
by individuals residing in reported municipalities. I exclude transactions not in
volving the exchange: inheritances, gifts, swaps, option exercises, marriage set
tlements, and direct sales like equity offerings. This eliminates less than 1% of
individuals' transactions. The resulting sample is the basis for the estimation.
For the empirical analysis, I use transactions in the 20 stocks with the highest
number of trades during the period December 1994-January 2004. Panel A of
Table 1 lists the stocks and the percent of total individual investor trades that they

comprise.
Nokia accounts for almost 17% of the trades by individuals in the database.
In the period studied, Nokia represented over half of the Finnish market capital

ization. In 2000 there were 94,500 Nokia common shareholders and 4,693,000
shares outstanding, but no shareholder owned 5% or more of the stock. In 2001,
approximately one-quarter of the trades originated in the United States, 15% orig
inated in Sweden, and less than 1% were traded by foreigners on the Helsinki

exchange.
The second most traded stock, Sonera, is a Finnish telecommunications com
pany headquartered in Helsinki. It was quite actively traded during its short public

existence from 1999 to 2002, when it merged with Telia in 2002, and represents
7% of the individual trades in the database.
The other 18 stocks are technology and telecommunications firms, financial
firms, and a paper mill. Each accounts for between 1% and 3.5% of the total num
ber of individual trades. The top 20 stocks used in this study make up 58.3% of all
trades by individuals. The firms range in average market cap over the period from

153 million euros to 75 billion euros. Some are located in just one municipality,
but one firm has locations in as many as 24, according to the addresses listed on
company Web sites.

FIGURE 1
Evolution of the Net Buy Orders in 100 Zip Code Areas (1997-2001)
These maps represent the buy and sell orders of Nokia stock in 100 zip code areas, aggregated from the 444 municipalities.
Zip code areas are 116 square miles, on average. The empty circles represent ?reas where there are more sell orders than
buy orders. The filled-in circles represent areas where there are more buy orders.

represent sections where sells outnumber buys. It is apparent that these areas form
a geographic pattern, and this pattern evolves over time as would an epidemic.
Further, the evolution of the buying patterns coincides with the price rise of 2000.

In 2000 and 2001, all zip codes have more individual investor buys than sells.
Thus, institutional and foreign investors were net sellers during this period. This
suggests that individuals may have been influential, at least for the smaller stocks
that are traded mostly in Finland, in determining stock prices during the "bubble"
period. The next section begins to examine this relation in the data.

B. Variables
1. Social Interaction
Panel of Table 1 presents firm-level summary statistics of the variables
used in the model. If SLpi is high in a particular group, there is more potential
for socially motivated trades. I measure share holdings directly by counting how
many people own the stock in each municipality on each day.
To obtain an estimate of the number of investors in each postal code, I sum
the number of individuals who have made any trade in any asset over the past
year and over the next year. The results are similar if the number of investors is
defined as all people who made a trade in the database. The total population of
individuals who have made any trade in the database is 1,211,121. There were ap
proximately 5,100,000 people in Finland during the sample period, and 3,400,000
were between the ages of 15 and 64. It appears that many of these people did not
participate directly in the equity market.
2. Control Variables Measuring Other Determinants of Trade
Other variables used in this study are meant to control for potential determi
nants of individual trade in equities as described in the previous section. Summary
statistics of the municipality-level variables appear in Table 2. In this table, but
not in the estimation, the 444 municipalities are grouped into 20 regions.
To control for the effects that news about a stock may have on trading,

NEWS7;i, is the number of news articles published in the Finnish and major
European business journals about firm j on days t and t ? 1. The journal arti
cles were gathered from Factiva. The average number of articles per day ranges
from 0.3 to 1.1, with a standard deviation ranging from 0.7 to 3, depending on
the stock. For a typical stock, there is no news for many days and then a flurry of
articles as an event occurs. Note that I did not attempt to classify the news as good
or bad, because it is difficult to know investor expectations before the news event
occurs. Many events might be interpreted as good news by some investors and
bad news by others.
Past weekly return, LRETURNy^, is the return on stock j from days t ? 8 to
t?1, taken from Datastream. LVOLUME^^ is the previous day's volume for stock
j and is meant to control for the stock-level attention that high volume attracts.
This variable was garnered from the database of trades.
Municipality-level INCOME/ is measured by the average income in munic
ipality i from Statistics Finland (www.stat.fi). The data were gathered in 2000,
which is in the middle of the sample period of the Finnish trading data. Since the

population's growth rate is less than 0.5% per year, I assume that it also remains
fairly stable in its demographic structure throughout the sample period.
In Section IV, I describe other variables that, though they are sometimes sta
tistically significant, do not change the significance of the results and thus are
not included in the model tabulated here. These include lagged buys and sells per

investor, additional lags of past volume and returns, other municipality charac
teristics such as education, and the squared number of owners per investor and
population size to rule out any potential dependencies on size.

C. Model Estimation and Results
1. Estimation Procedure
I estimate the model described in the previous section monthly for each of
the 20 stocks in a panel tobit setup with municipality random effects. I use a panel

model in order to account for municipality effects, and I use a tobit model because
the dependent variables, daily buys and sells per investor, can only assume 0 or

positive values. Unlike in linear regression, in a tobit model there is a positive
probability that the dependent variable is 0 and no probability of negative values.
A good reference for information about the tobit model is Wooldridge (2002).
In this setup, I use random municipality effects because the maximum like
lihood estimator in nonlinear panel data models with fixed effects is known to
be biased and inconsistent. This is due to the "incidental parameters problem"

when , the length of the time series, is fixed (see Neyman and Scott (1948)).

The random effects tobit model corrects for cluster effects in the covariance ma
trix and autocorrelation in the error terms. Controlling for cluster effects automat

ically controls for heteroskedasticity. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on an
appropriate R2 measure for panel tobit models.
The expected number of trades per investor may change over time due to
influences possibly not captured by any of the control variables. Due to the size of
the data set, I can alleviate this potential problem by estimating the model monthly
with daily data for each stock. The aggregate results appear in Tables 3 and 4.

TABLE 3
Univariate Panel Tobit for Buys and Sells
The dependent variables are DAILY.B.UYS per investor and DAILY_SEI_LS per investor, with municipality random effects.

Median parameter values are by stock. SLpi is the owners nonowners of the stock per investor in the municipality.
Coefficients are multiplied by 10,000. Percentage of positive coefficients and median p-values are below estimates. Bolded
terms have median p-values below 0.10 and have 90% of estimates with the same sign.

both buys and sells. Nokia and Sonera, the most frequently traded stocks, have
smaller coefficients, suggesting that social effects are weaker for the most liquid

stocks.

NHOLDPI, the percentage of investors who own the stock, has a positive
median coefficient in 14 cases out of 20 and is significantly positive for 6 stocks.
For sells, the median coefficient is positive in 17 out of 20 cases, and statistically
significant in 8 cases. This reflects the fact that only stock owners can sell the
stock, and the higher the percentage of owners in a municipality, the more sales
per person there are likely to be.
The median monthly coefficient on NEWS is positive in 19 out of 20 cases
for buys, and 18 out of 20 cases for sells, although the sign changes many times on
a month-to-month basis. The combination of low median p-values and ambiguous
(though usually positive) sign of the relation suggests that both buys and sells are
generally related to the amount of recent news about the firm, but that some news

dampens the desire to buy, to sell, or both. Investors might sometimes adopt a
"wait and see" attitude, expecting more news. It is difficult to construct a variable
that consistently measures investor expectations about a stock and the direction of
the changes in those expectations brought about by news, but it is likely that the
effect of news is stable in each particular month in which I estimate the model.
LRETURN is generally negatively related to buys and positively related to
sells, and this relation is much stronger for sells. The negative relation with sells is

consistent with the disposition effect, in which individuals tend to sell their win
ning stocks and hold onto their losers. The results for buys indicate that investors
tend to look for stocks that have recently fallen in value, possibly in the hope that
they will rebound. LVOLUME has no consistent relation to buys or sells.

The municipality-specific variables are also related to trading behavior.
INCOME is always positive and is significant in most cases. Thus, municipali
ties with more income per investor trade more. Population density (POPDENS) is
generally positively related to trading, although the effect is not as strong as that

of INCOME.

D. Economic Significance
To examine the economic significance of the results, I compute the estimated

percentage change in the number of individual buys and sells for a 1 % change4
in each explanatory variable. The results are presented in Table 5. Here I discuss
only the variables that were statistically significant in the tables. A 1% change
in SLpi is associated with a 2% increase in the number of subsequent individual
buys, and also a 2% increase in the number of individual sells. In comparison, a
1% change in the proportion of owners of the stock increases buys by 2% and sells
by 7%. A 1% change in the number of news articles has a more modest effect, at
1% for both buys and sells. INCOME has a very large effect, and a 1% change

is associated with 61% and 89% change in buys and sells, respectively. Recall

4I do not compute the effect of a one-standard-deviation change in the variables because some
have no time-series standard deviation, and the cross-sectional standard deviation is not a meaningful
measure of variability for one municipality.

that this is a purely cross-sectional implication, since I have only one income
estimate in 2000 for each municipality. This is likely due to the presence of high
income Helsinki in the sample. In untabulated results, I remove Helsinki, and the
coefficient on income drops by 2A and is much less often statistically significant.

TABLE 5
Average Effect on Buys and Sells of a 1% Increase in Variables at their Means
SLpi is the number of owners the number of nonowners of the stock per investor, NHOLDPNs the number of owners of the
stock per investor (only relevant for sales), NEWS is the number of news articles in the Finnish and major European business
newspapers in the current and previous day, LRETURN is the return on the stock in the previous week, LVOLUME is the
volume on the previous day, INCOME is the average income of the people in the municipality, and POPDENS is the popula
tion density. For example, the effect on the number of daily individual investor buys of an average stock of a 1 % increase in

SLpi is the average over all of the stocks of /3BUYS x AVERAGE; (SLpi) AVERAGE; (#INVESTORS/MUNICIPALITY)

E. Returns

In a situation where a trade in one direction i
vestors cannot distinguish which trades convey
likely to change at each trade even when there i
reversals possible later. In this section, I test whe
returns.
Ll?rente, Michaely, Saar, and Wang (2002) show, in a sample of NYSE and
AMEX stocks, that returns generated by trades that do not appear to contain in
formation are subsequently reversed, while returns generated by trades they label
as informed have a permanent impact on prices. To examine the effect of social
trading on returns, I form an equal-weighted portfolio of the 20 stocks. I inves
tigate the time-series relation between a monthly measure of the total number

of buys and sells caused by social interaction, respectively, SOCIAL-BUYS^ =
?j,b,sociAhSj,tIj,t and SOCIAL_SELLS7V = #>,socialS?^,?, equal weighted over
firms j, and the raw monthly returns on the portfolio.

The results are presented in Panel A of Table 6. Heteroskedasticity-robust p
values are in parentheses, and bolded terms are significant at the 10% level. The
table shows that returns are positively related to social buys in the current month
and following month, but only the following month is statistically significant.
The socially motivated sales paint a different picture. Social sales are negatively
related to returns in the current month but not in the following month. The coeffi

cient is positive in the following month but not significant, so one cannot conclude
that there are reversals in the price effect of social trading. Since there are no ap
parent reversals in returns in the next month for the effects of social buys or sells,

the information shared between investors seems to have some merit in predicting

at least short-term stock returns.

Since contemporaneous returns are related to the amount of social buying
and selling, can these return effects be predicted? The social variables are quite

predictable. Adjusted R2s for the prediction of SOCIAL_BUYS and SOCIAL.
SELLS based on their first 2 lags are 0.48 and 0.63, respectively. The results of re

gressing monthly returns on the predicted SOCIAlSuYS and SOCIAlIsELLS

appear in Panel A of Table 6. Both SOC?aLbUYS and SOCI?l5eLLS are
significantly related to returns.
As control variables in the model of returns, I include the total number of in

dividual buys and sells. Total buys are negatively related to returns in the current

and 2 subsequent months, and total sells are positively related to returns in the
current month, but the relation is ambiguous for subsequent months. Linnainmaa
(2010) conjectures that well-informed institutions pick off individuals' stale limit
orders, so that contemporaneous returns vary in the opposite direction as individ
ual investor trades. This effect is distinct from the effect of trades due to social
interaction. While limit orders that get picked off by institutions are stale trades,

likely from past days or weeks, trades motivated by recent social interaction are

TABLE 6
Social Trades and Stock Returns
Panel A. Monthly Portfolio Returns
Equal-weighted portfolio regressions use an equal-weighted portfolio composed of the stocks present in the sample during
each month. Here, SOCIALBUYS is the estimated number of buy transactions due to social interaction, and SOCIALSELLS
is the estimated number of sell transactions due to social interaction. Both are equal weighted across the stocks present
in the sample in each month. BUYS and SELLS are the equal-weighted number of buys and sells by individuals. A hat
on a variable signifies that it is the predicted value of that variable based on its own 2 lags. Coefficients are multiplied by
10,000. Heteroskedasticity-robust p-values are in parentheses.

more likely to be active trades. In untabulated results, I reestimate the model in
cluding buy and sell volume or lagged monthly returns. Inclusion of these variables
does not change the significance of the social parameters. R2s from the regressions
in the table range from 0.06 to 0.55 for the full model.
Panel of Table 6 presents 2 of the results of Panel A of Table 6 on a stock
by-stock basis. Some stocks do not exist for many months, so it is not possible to

include all of the control variables, but the pattern is similar to that found in the
equal-weighted index. For SOCIAL_BUYS, 16 out of 20 coefficients are positive,

and 15 out of 20 are negative for SOCIAL_SELLS. For SOCIALBUYS, 17 out
of 20 coefficients are positive, and 13 out of 20 are negative for SOCIALJSELLS.
Last, Granger causality test results after a vector autoregression with 3 lags,

SOCIALBUYS and SOCIALJSELLS together Granger-cause returns (p = 0.01),
but returns do not Granger-cause either of these variables (p ? 0.26 and = 0.96

for SOCIALBUYS and SOCIAL_SELLS, respectively).

IV. Robustness Tests on the Specification
A. Omitted Variables
It is possible that a variable omitted from the model and correlated with
the social variable is the true driver of trades. While this is difficult to imagine
because the social variable varies daily and by municipality, I have reestimated
the results using several other control variables. Adding in the number of owners
per investor, NHOLDPI, in the buy model or the squared number of owners di
vided by the number of investors in either equation does not change the results.
Adding the total population size of a municipality, its area, the average age, and
the percentage of males also has no effect. Population density, the interaction of
population density with SLpi, and the interaction of NHOLDPI with each of the
other variables also does not affect the significance of SLpi, although the mag
nitude of the coefficient sometimes increases. Finally, past returns on each stock
at monthly or yearly horizons and past volume and number of buys and sells per
investor at weekly or yearly horizons do not change the results.
Potentially, the dependent variable, although it is already a ratio of the num
ber of trades per investor, is still related to population size. If the social interaction
variable is also related to size, the significance of the results might be unduly in
creased. In robustness tests, I control for both total population size, number of
investors, and lagged number of buys and sells per investor, and this does not
affect the significance of the results.

B. Number of Areas
Most people reside and work in the same municipality, and the spatial gran
ularity of the data was chosen to reflect this. However, it is reasonable to question
whether the result is sensitive to this choice. The smaller the areas being consid
ered, the more area-day observations there are, but fewer trades can be identified
as caused by social influence, since influence between areas is not measured. On
the other hand, with larger areas there will be more trades per area and fewer area
effects, and thus the parameters should be more precisely estimated. To investi
gate whether the result is robust to the chosen granularity of the data, I replicate
the results for both the 20 major Finnish regions and 100 areas obtained by aggre
gating the 444 municipalities, and I find similar results.
A related question is whether the coefficients vary with area size. Although
controlling for area size does not dampen the significance of SLpi as mentioned

188 Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
above, it is still plausible that the coefficients are different, since SLpi tends to
be much larger for large areas. Although this is unlikely given the results of the
previous paragraph, potentially only one area size is driving the results. To in
vestigate this possibility, I reestimate the model for the lowest quartile (less than
133 investors), the middle half (133-578 investors), and the largest quartile of
municipality sizes measured by the number of investors in each municipality. The
untabulated results show that the coefficients are much larger for the smallest
municipalities than for the larger municipalities, as would be expected given the
multiplicative nature of the variable, but they remain generally significant across

all size bins.

One possible reaction to this would be to divide SLpi again by N. In effect,
this would be modeling the proportion of new infections as the product of the
proportion of infected and the proportion of susceptible people. Intuitively, this
assumes that people interact only with a fixed number of people no matter what
the population size of their area. The truth is likely to lie somewhere in between
the two specifications.

Although such a setup is also occasionally used in epidemiology, a model
with TV2 in the denominator is not appealing in my study for two reasons. While
the assumption of a fixed number of contacts may be reasonable for sexually trans
mitted diseases, for example, it does not describe the transmission of ideas well,
and rumor models (Moreno, Nekovee, and Pacheco (2004)), which are closer in
spirit to this paper, tend to use the original setup with N. The second reason that

this variable would not work well here is that S I/N2 typically correlates very
highly with the number of owners per investor, I/N. While there is no reason to
put I/N in an epidemic model for disease transmission, it is meaningful econom
ically, especially in modeling sales per investor when short sales are not allowed.

C. Range of the Data
The model assumes that the population of investors in the area remains
stable over the (monthly) estimation period. In this case, the product of S and /
is increasing while the number of infected makes up less than half of the popula
tion, and decreasing in / thereafter. The number of people infected per period is
uniformly increasing in SLpi, so the infection rate will slow as more people be
come infected. Panel of Table 1 shows that the number of owners per investor
remains in the range where SLpi is increasing in /. The maximum mean number
of owners per investor is for Sonera, where it is at 0.23 with a standard devia
tion of 0.15 The minimum average is for Tietoenator and Stonesoft, where 2%
of investors own the stock. While it would be interesting to test if the number of
buys per investor is still increasing in SLpi when this variable is decreasing in the
number of investors, the data do not permit this test. Given the increasing number
of stocks that investors have to choose from, it is likely that the percentage of
investors owning each particular security will continue to fall.

D. A Pure Time-Series Specification
One could also estimate time-series tobit models for each one of the regions
and investigate (and make sure there exists) a purely time-series relation of buys

Shive 189
and sells to SLpi. The benefit of this specification is that one can see if SI_pi
is related to trading in a time-series manner rather than in a more cross-sectional
manner, and a monthly specification may not capture much variation in SLpi. The
disadvantage of this type of model is that there is no consensus in the literature on
how to correct for the large growth in participation and trading over the 9 years of

the data set.

For each stock j, I estimate the following tobit models on each municipality
that trades the stock for at least 50 months during the sample period:

Total JBuysJ>erJnvestor/Jr = /%>,social(SLp??j?)

+ / Wews(NEWS7V) + /^^lr(LRETURN?; r) + ^ALV (LVOLUME^)
+ Lag_Total_Buys_Per Jnvestor?j^,

TotaLSells J>erJnvestorZJ> = #>,sociAL(Sl4>i/j</jf)
+ ^.owners (NHOLDPI/Jfi) + A>,news (NEWS,-,) + /?7>,LR(LRETURN7V)

+ /??*,Lv(LVOLUME^
There are two differences between these models and the models for buys
and sells presented in Table 4. First, municipality characteristics do not appear
because this model is run individually on each municipality. Second, I include
lagged total buys and total sells per investor in an attempt to correct for the trend
in total buys and sells over time. While I include lagged buys per investor and
lagged sells per investor in robustness checks in the model presented in Table 4,
they do not affect the results. This model, however, spans over 9 years, and so
these lags are more likely to be important.
In the model for buys, the median coefficients on SLpi are positive in 19
cases out of 20 and significant in 12 of these cases. For sells, the coefficient on
SLpi is positive in 16 out of 20 cases, 9 of which are significant and 1 of which is
significantly negative. I choose the model presented in Table 4, however, to alle
viate potential concerns about correctly controlling for the effects of participation
rates and expected volume changes over the 9-year time period.

E. A Negative Binomial Model
As an alternative to the tobit specification, one could describe the number of
individual trades with a count model. An appropriate count model for this setup
is the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model, a more general variant of

the Poisson model. Zero inflation is necessary because there are many "0" ob

servations in these data. A zero-inflated model assumes that the data are from 2
processes, 1 of which generates only 0s. In this a model, the independent vari
ables are the total number of investors, the social effect variable measured as the
total number of owners the number of nonowners, and the municipalities' total
income, as well as the other control variables left as they are.

A ZINB model produces strong significance for both the social interaction
factor and for the measure of total investor population. I choose the tobit model
of trades per investor instead, however, because this eliminates the correlation
between the measure of social interaction (S /) and the measure of the number
of investors (? + /), which is sometimes high. Correlations like these can inflate

coefficients and would preclude a study of the economic significance of the social
effect. Linear regressions produce equally strong results but are inappropriate due
to the strictly positive dependent variable.

F. A Testable Prediction: Is Social Trading Related Across
Municipalities?
Although it is consistent across different municipality sizes, the analysis in
this paper measures social interactions inside municipalities only and ignores any
possible influence across municipalities. If there is in fact social influence on in
dividual trading, some of this influence should spill over into neighboring mu
nicipalities. In this section, I use 2 measures of spatial correlation to address this
question, Moran's / and Geary's C.
Moran's / divides the spatial autocovariance by the variance of the data. It is
computed as follows:

, .s (/==^?w(iJ)
i* -,
Moran
---r=-=-

x) (xj - *) \

where Af is the number of municipalities; is /^social or /^social estimated
across all months value for each municipality, with year-month random effects;
is the mean of the x? w(i, j) is 1 if regions / and y are neighbors and 0 otherwise;
and So is the sum of all of the w(i, j). I use the coefficients only and not the number

of social trades, in order to analyze the propensity to trade socially in isolation of

the opportunities for social influence, which are naturally spatially correlated due
to population density.

The expected value of Moran's I is ?l/(N? 1), so one cannot compare
results across stocks where may differ. A negative value of Moran's / sig
nifies negative spatial correlation, and a positive value signifies positive spatial
correlation.

Geary's C divides the sum of squared differences between pairs of data-in
stead of deviations from the mean, by the variance of the data. This is perhaps
more relevant in this study where there are many municipalities. The formula for

Geary's C is as follows:

r , r N-l
fT?=iT?=MiJ)(xi-Xj)2\
Geary
s C =
- '- 1

2*0 V Ef=1fe-x)2 )'

The expected value of Geary's C is LA Geary's C above 1 signifies negative
spatial correlation, while a value below 1 signifies positive spatial correlation.
These measures require a matrix of Is and 0s that conveys which munici
palities are neighbors. I determine this by using the spatial coordinates of each
municipality and by specifying a maximum distance between municipality cen
ters for them to be defined as neighbors.

The theoretical bounds on Moran's / and Geary's C can be tighter than

[?1,1] and [0,2], respectively, depending on the characteristics of the space and
of the weight matrix. In this study, the weighting matrix is sparse because most of

Shive 191
the 444 municipalities are not neighbors to most other municipalities. Since the
weighting matrix is composed of Os except where one region is a neighbor to the
other, the realized measures of spatial correlation will be low in absolute value.
Table 7 shows the results of these calculations for both buys and sells for
each stock. Bolded terms are significant at the 10% level. The table shows that
the 2 measures of spatial correlation are consistent in picking up positive spatial
correlation, for both the 25- and 50-km criteria for municipalities to be consid
ered neighbors. Consistent with the theory that social effects are local, the co
efficients are slightly weaker when the definition of neighbors is expanded to a
50-km radius.

V. Alternative Explanations
Models of endogenous effects are subject to what Manski (1993) terms the
"reflection problem." Inferring whether the average behavior of a group influences
the behavior of an individual is difficult because one cannot disentangle the effects

of almost simultaneous actions on the part of the group and of the individual. The

dynamic model of trading in this study avoids this problem because the social
variable is measured before trading occurs on each day.
Although the model also controls for known determinants of individual in
vestor trade and is robust to the inclusion of a variety of other variables and to
different specifications, I investigate several alternative explanations for these
results, including unobserved municipality-level characteristics; insider trading;
local news, TV, and radio; local stockbrokers; and tax-loss trading.

A. Insiders and the Location of Firms
It could be that the effects found here are driven solely by employees of the
firms. Employee trades will be correlated in time, clustering when they receive
relevant information, and in space, since employees most likely live near their
workplace. To investigate whether employees are driving the results, I exclude
all of the municipalities where each firm operates and reestimate the model. The
number of municipalities thus excluded for each firm can be found in Table 1
in the right-most column. About half of the firms have headquarters in one city,
usually Helsinki. The other half have multiple locations. One firm, Tietoenator,
has 155 Finnish locations in 24 municipalities. In untabulated results, the effect
of social interaction is slightly stronger when the firm's locations are removed.
This could be because local news about the firm is less likely in an area far away
from its location, and thus there is more need to rely on information gleaned from
social interaction.

B. Current Owners Purchasing Again
Possibly, investors are not communicating but current share owners are buy
ing the same stock repeatedly. I control for the number of owners in the sell equa

tion because only owners may legally sell the stock, so this is only a concern for

the buy equation. As specified in Section IV, I control for both the number of

owners per investor in the buy equation and the squared number of owners per
investor in both equations and find that they do not affect the results.

C. News Not Covered in National Newspapers
1. Local Newspapers
While I have controlled for the daily number of articles in the Finnish na
tional and major European newspapers that investors are likely to read, I have not

controlled for the number of articles from local newspapers. Potentially, daily lo
cal news about the companies could drive the results. It is unlikely that the daily

local news about a stock is related to the prior day's product of the number of
owners and the number of nonowners of a stock, unless the resulting discussions
about the stock make it into the local news. Moreover, since I have controlled for
national news and run the model without local companies in the prior section, the
local news would have to be both about nonlocal stocks and also unrelated to the

news in the national newspapers. Nevertheless, to test the possibility that local
news is driving the effect, I investigate all 94 Finnish local newspapers listed on
the Web site, www.onlinenewspapers.com. Of these, 74 have working Web sites
in May 2007.1 search for a section related to investing, and I find that 17 newspa
pers have company news on the front page or a section labeled "Talous" (Finnish)
or "Ekonomi" (Swedish) for "Economy." This is a broad topic, and 4 of the 17
newspapers do not mention any company name in this section. The most common
subsections in these local newspapers seem to be variants of "Mielipide" (opin
ion), "Urheilu" (sports), and "Kulttuuri" (culture). This agrees well with Statistics
Finland's report that only 8% to 9% of local newspaper space was devoted to the
economy between 1991 and 2000. Given these results, I am confident that local
newspapers are unlikely to cause the daily patterns in individual investor trades.

2. TV and Radio
According to Statistics Finland, the Finnish television market in 2000 was
less than half the size of the newspaper market, which was 1,166 million euros
in 2000. Approximately 56% of the Finnish population watched television on a
given day during the period, and 85% listened to radio. Approximately 20% of
the programming of the 3 main channels was either news or current affairs, which
would include some firm-level news. While I cannot investigate the historical tele
vision and radio news stories, the firm-level news is likely to be correlated with
that which is found in the daily newspapers, especially since it is predominantly
national news. As with the newspapers, any local news would have to be about
nonlocal stocks, since I have removed the local stocks in a previous robustness

check.

D. Local Brokers
Possibly, the effect presented here is driven by local brokers in each munici
pality who are pushing stocks daily to their clients in a manner that is unrelated to
daily news. Finland is much like the United States in terms of investing in individ

ual stocks. There are approximately 150 members and 1,200 authorized brokers

on the Helsinki exchange. Trading by individuals can take place in person at a
branch, over the phone, or via the Internet. Given the many brokers and methods
of trading that are available to each investor, I believe it is unlikely that individual

stockbrokers alone could influence significant numbers of traders. Furthermore,
if local brokers are behind individual investor trades, one would expect that the

number of buys and sells would be related to the number of investors in a mu
nicipality, measured by the intercept, since this is a model of trades per investor.

Although it is often significant, the intercept is not shown in the tables in or
der to preserve space and because it could capture many different unobserved
municipality-level characteristics. In any case, the interaction term measuring
social influence remains significant.

E. Tax-Loss Trading
Investors may trade solely to realize their losses and lessen their taxes. This
type of trading could not be responsible for the entire effect measured here, be
cause it should only affect the sale of securities and not the purchases. Neverthe
less, I reestimate the results after deleting all December estimates. The results are
similar and are not reported.

VI. Characterization of Social Effects
A. The Determinants of Social Trading
To examine the factors that influence social trading, I regress median
firm-level estimates of AVG.SOCIAL, which is the average over all firms j of
(AjASOCiAL + Aj,j,social), for each municipality /, on municipality-level vari
ables. I sum the two betas because they are each a positive measure of the propen
sity to trade socially. The municipality-level variables are from Statistics Finland
and are summarized in Table 2.

The first variable that might explain the propensity to trade socially,
SWEDISH, is the percent of Swedish-speaking people in the municipality.
Swedish people are the largest minority in Finland, and possibly their social and
investing habits are different from those of the majority. DTOWORK is the aver
age distance to work in kilometers. It is meant to capture possible differences in
social investing if a person resides far away from his or her work, and thus may
not have time to interact with colleagues during leisure time (note that this is not
the same thing as population density, which I control for in Section IV). I expect
DTOWORK to have a negative effect on social trading, but it is possible that large
social networks exist outside of a person's work, in which case the predicted sign

may be positive.
I also include UNIV, the percentage of people who hold university degrees,

and INCOME, the median income of the municipality. It is not a priori clear
if these will help explain social-interaction-based trading. TURNOVER, the
turnover of inhabitants of the municipality, should decrease the social trading ef
fect by breaking social bonds, and KIOSKSPP, the number of kiosks per person in
the municipality, is meant to proxy for news, an alternative source of information

available to investors. If more kiosks means more availability of timely informa
tion about firms, investors may rely less on their acquaintances. Alternatively,
availability of financial news might make stocks the topic of conversation more

often.

The results of these cross-sectional regressions are presented by firm in

Table 8. Panel A presents a correlation matrix, and Panel presents the uni
variate and multivariate regressions. The coefficient of SWEDISH is insignifi
cant, suggesting that Swedes and Finns have the same propensity to trade socially.

DTOWORK is significant and positive. It seems that access to work colleagues
at nonwork hours is not a determinant of increased social trading. UNIV and
INCOME are negative and significant on their own, but the significance goes
away in the multivariate setting. Since their correlation coefficient is 0.85, they
are most likely measuring similar things. This and the sign of the coefficient on
distance to work hint that trades from rural municipalities are more likely to be

TABLE 8
Explaining Social Trading with Municipality-Level Data
Details about the variables are presented in Table 2. The dependent variable is SOCIAL = /3buy + /3sell, estimated
at the municipality level with year-month fixed effects. SWEDISH is the percentage of people in a municipality who are
Swedish. DTOWORK is the average commute in kilometers. POPDENS is the population density of a municipality. UNIV

is the proportion of inhabitants with a university degree. INCOME is the average income in euros. TURNOVER is the
proportion of the population that moves in or out each year. KIOSKSPP is the number of news kiosks per inhabitant.
Coefficients are multiplied by 10,000 except KIOSKSPP. Heteroskedasticity-robust p-values are in parentheses. Bolded
terms are significant at the 10% level.

social. TURNOVER is not a significant factor of social trading, and KIOSKSPP
is negatively related to social trading, which supports the idea that availability of
news lessens social influence on trading. In brief, social trading is not explained
well by any of the static, municipality-level characteristics shown here.

B. Social Effects Over Time
An important question is whether, in the more recent days of the Internet
and easy access to news, social influence on trading behavior has changed. Graph

per municipality over the sample period, which is A,,socialSJt and /^socialS^

the equal-weighted average of the buying parameters, /^social, and selling pa
rameters, ?Sisocial- In the background is the average, S I. This figure suggests
that susceptibility to social influence is generally decreasing over time, but that
the social factors, St lu are increasing. There is a slight decrease near the end
of the sample, which corresponds to the bursting of the technology bubble. Per
haps individual investors shrank away from the market at that time. The increase
is most likely due to the increasing percentage of stock owners in the population.
Thus, increased stock market participation in general, especially when the new
investors are naive, may lead to unforseen consequences due to the influences of
other traders.

VII. Conclusion
Using a new measure of social influence on trading, this paper tests whether
social influence is an important determinant of daily individual investor trades.
Controlling for recent news, past returns, volume, and municipality-level charac
teristics (e.g., education and income), I find significant social effects on individual
investor trading in data on all individual investor trades in the 20 most frequently
traded Finnish stocks between 1995 and 2003. The effects of social trading are

economically significant.
I also show that socially motivated trading can predict stock returns. Individ
uals themselves over time have become less susceptible to social influence but are
more subject to it, and thus the number of trades caused by social influence in
creases slightly over the sample period. In robustness checks, I find that the effect
measured by the social variable is not due to employees of the traded firms, the
model specification, or the granularity of the data. I also rule out several alterna
tive explanations.
This study shows that investor location data may also shed light on the na
ture of price changes and on whether prices are away from fundamental value.
The results suggest that the market is fairly efficient, because it would take more
information than is easily available about trader location for an investor to spot
potential mispricings before they correct themselves. It also implies that policies
encouraging investors to collect their own information by lowering the cost of

independent research or improving its effectiveness may lessen the amount of
socially motivated trading and its effects on prices.
