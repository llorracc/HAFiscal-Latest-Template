Human populations are arranged in social networks that determine interactions and influence the spread
of diseases, behaviours and ideas. We evaluate the spread of long-term emotional states across a social
network. We introduce a novel form of the classical susceptible – infected –susceptible disease model
which includes the possibility for ‘spontaneous’ (or ‘automatic’) infection, in addition to disease transmission (the SISa model). Using this framework and data from the Framingham Heart Study, we
provide formal evidence that positive and negative emotional states behave like infectious diseases spreading across social networks over long periods of time. The probability of becoming content is increased by
0.02 per year for each content contact, and the probability of becoming discontent is increased by 0.04
per year per discontent contact. Our mathematical formalism allows us to derive various quantities from
the data, such as the average lifetime of a contentment ‘infection’ (10 years) or discontentment ‘infection’
(5 years). Our results give insight into the transmissive nature of positive and negative emotional states.
Determining to what extent particular emotions or behaviours are infectious is a promising direction for
further research with important implications for social science, epidemiology and health policy. Our
model provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also
arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviours, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs.

1. INTRODUCTION
Social network effects are of great importance for understanding human behaviour. People interact with different
numbers of individuals and with some individuals more
than others, and this affects behaviour in fundamental
ways. Investigations from diverse fields, including sociology, economics, physics, mathematics and public
health, have studied social networks, both to understand
their structure and their affect on social dynamics.
Economic behaviour, such as purchasing decisions
(Lazarsfeld & Katz 1955), employment prospects
(Marmaros & Sacerdote 2002; Calvo-Armengol &
Jackson 2004), bankruptcy (Uzzi 1996), investment
(Cohen et al. 2008) and productivity (Oswald et al.
2009) have been shown to be influenced by network contacts (reviewed in Jackson 2009). Other behaviours such
as college GPA (Sacerdote 2001) and crime (Glaeser
et al. 1996; Haynie 2001) have been related to peer
effects. Recently, social networks have been studied as
determinants of health (reviewed by Smith & Christakis
2008), ranging from determining the patterns of infectious disease spread (Keeling & Eames 2005) to the

propagation of behaviours such as smoking cessation
(Christakis & Fowler 2008), obesity (Christakis &
Fowler 2007) and suicidal ideation (Bearman & Moody
2004). Networks also play an important role in evolutionary biology, where population structure determining
interactions can facilitate the evolution of cooperative
behaviour (Ohtsuki et al. 2006; Tarnita et al. 2009a,b;
Nowak & May 1992; Fu et al. 2007).
Human emotions are strongly influenced by social
contacts. ‘Emotional contagion’ (Hatfield et al. 1994) is
known to occur over short timesscales between people
in frequent close contact, such as families (Larson &
Almeida 1999), roommates (Howes et al. 1985) and
team-mates (Barsade 2002), and even occurs in experimental situations (Fowler & Christakis 2010). Positive
and negative moods also spread during workplace interactions such as cooperation (Barsade 2002), negotiation
(Van Kleef et al. 2004) and successful leadership (Bono &
Ilies 2006). The spread of positive mood is a common
technique in interpersonal relations, and the ‘service
with a smile’ technique is a well-known example (Pugh
2001). Depressive moods and symptoms have been
found to be contagious both by media and by personal
contact with strangers or acquaintances ( Joiner & Katz
1999). Over longer timescales, clinically relevant
depressive states can also spread between social contacts
(Ueno 2005). Unlike most of these previous studies, in
the present work we demonstrate the interpersonal

spread of long-lasting emotional states over protracted
timescales.
Recently, Fowler & Christakis (2008) have studied the
properties of happiness in relation to a network of social
contacts, extracted from the Framingham Heart Study
(Dawber 1980). They observe correlations in happiness
between individuals who are connected in a social network. If your friends are happy, then you are more likely
to be happy in the future. This correlation, they suggest,
is caused in part by an inductive effect of happiness
spreading from person to person. Thus, happiness could
be thought of as a form of social infection. Here, we
evaluate this conceptual approach to emotional transmission in a mathematically rigorous way, by formally
modelling the spread of positive and negative emotions
using theoretical tools from epidemiology.
Mathematical models for the spread of microbial infections help us to understand and predict the spread of
disease (Anderson & May 1991). Such models have also
been used to explore the spread of non-microbial infections, such as rumours (Daley & Kendall 1964) or
computer viruses (Pastor-Satorras & Vespignani 2001).
Studying the dynamics of epidemiological models on
social networks is currently an active area of research.
Many models have been developed to study how the
structure of networks affects disease spread (Keeling &
Eames 2005). These models have been used to understand contagious diseases where the network describes
contacts in geographical proximity (for example severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Meyers et al. 2005;
foot-and-mouth disease, Ferguson et al. 2001) or for
studying sexually transmitted diseases where the network
consists of sexual partnerships (Eames & Keeling 2002).
Here, we introduce a novel approach for studying the
spread of emotions in a social network. We can think of
emotions at three levels: ‘moods’, ‘states’ or ‘traits’.
These levels have increasing duration and permanence,
and differ in terms of the extent to which they are
deeply characteristic of the individual, and therefore the
extent to which they are mutable or immutable. We will
use the word ‘long-term emotional states’ to describe
the phenomena of interest to us here, lying in between
fleeting moods and permanent traits (like personality
traits). We use the terms content and discontent for these
phenomena that have been characterized, in prior work,
as akin to happiness and depression, with validated
scales. We modify a classical infectious disease model to
represent the spread of emotions, to account for the fact
that emotions can be contracted both spontaneously
and through transmission. We then use this model to
ask whether emotional states in the Framingham Heart
Study dataset (Dawber 1980) do indeed act like infectious diseases. For an emotional state such as content to
fit the classical definition of an infectious disease, (i) the
probability of becoming content must depend on the
number of content contacts (and not on the number of
non-content contacts), and (ii) the probability of switching from content back to neutral (‘recovering’ from
content) should be independent of any properties of
social contacts. The particular structure of the Framingham Heart Study dataset, with a social network, reliable
emotional evaluation and longitudinal follow-up, allows
application of our model to the spread of content and discontent over long timescales. We find that both content

processes by which an individual’s state can change. (i) An

her contacts. (b) The rates of movement for an individual

and discontent behave like infectious diseases. The data
allow us to then estimate values for model parameters,
and to calculate derived quantities which give insight
into the dynamics of emotional contagion.
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
(a) Basic infectious disease model
In the simplest infectious disease models (Anderson &
May 1991), individuals are classified as occupying one
of two states: ‘susceptible’, meaning they do not have
the disease, and ‘infected’, meaning they do have the disease. The disease can be transmitted to a susceptible
person when they come into contact with an infected
person. The rate of this disease transmission from
infected to susceptible is defined as b, the transmission
rate. Once an individual is infected, he/she recovers
from the disease at a constant rate g, regardless of his/
her contact with susceptible or infected others. In one
class of disease models (susceptible – infected –recovered
(SIR)), recovered individuals become immune to further
infection and enter a ‘recovered’ state. However, an
emotion can occur many times over an individual’s life,
and therefore we use assume infected individuals return
to the susceptible state after recovering. This form of
susceptible– infected –susceptible (SIS) model is used to
model infectious diseases that do not confer immunity,
such as many sexually transmitted diseases.
In the standard SIS model, infection can only be transmitted by having a contact between an infected and a
susceptible individual. Emotional ‘infections’, however,
can also arise owing to spontaneous factors other than
transmission. Therefore, we extend the SIS model by
adding a term whereby uninfected individuals spontaneously (or ‘automatically’) become infected at a
constant rate a, independent of infected contacts. A
diagrammatic representation of our modified SIS
model, which we will call SISa, is shown in figure 1.

Infectious emotions in a social network
The corresponding differential equations for a well-mixed
population are described in equation (2.1). When the
population is not well-mixed but instead constrained on
a social network, the transmission rate for each individual
depends on the number of infected contacts (nI) instead
of the total number of infected individuals (I ).

and I þ S ¼ N;
where S is the number of susceptible individuals, I the
number of infected individuals b the transmission rate,
g the recovery rate, and a the rate of spontaneous infection. This model assumes a constant population size,
neglecting birth and death.
(b) Parameter estimation
The classical definition of an infectious disease in the SIS/
SIR context is that (i) the probability of an individual
transitioning from susceptible to infected is an increasing
function of the number of infected contacts, while (ii) the
probability of a transition from infected to susceptible
(i.e. recovery) is independent of the number or state of
contacts. Exposure to infected individuals makes you
more likely to become sick, but once you are infected
you recover at a constant rate regardless of contacts. In
addition to infectious contagion, the SISa model has an
additional spontaneous mode of acquiring disease. To
both test that a behaviour displays infectious-disease-like
dynamics, and to estimate values for the model parameters a, b and g, we can use dynamic information
about transitions between states based on multiple time
points in longitudinal data. For data points separated by
time intervals (Dt) smaller than the average time between
transitions, the transition probabilities can be linearized.
The probability of a transition from susceptible to
infected after a time Dt can be given by P(S ! I, Dt) 
(a þ bnI)Dt, and the probability of transition from
infected to susceptible after time Dt, by P(I ! S, Dt)
gDt. It is necessary for the time between measurements
to not be comparable to or greater than the average
lifetime of a state to keep the probability of double
transitions within a time interval low.
(c) Dataset
In this study, we evaluate the assumption that emotions
behave like infectious agents. We use data from the Framingham Heart Study (Dawber 1980) and the
framework discussed above to test whether content and
discontent fit the dynamics of infectious diseases. The
Framingham study was initiated in 1948 in Framingham,
Massachusetts and has continued enrolling subjects till
the present. Subjects were examined at regular intervals
of approximately three years. They were administered a
psycho-social exam called the CES-D, which allowed us
to classify each individual as content, discontent or neutral.
We used the well-defined cut-off of a score of 16 on the
full CES-D scale to classify subjects as discontent. This
measure has previously been called ‘depression’, though
it is not specific to clinical depression and represents
Proc. R. Soc. B (2010)

general distress or depressive symptoms (Rush 2007).
Content was defined as a score of 12 on the positively
worded questions of the CES-D, and is the same subscale
used by others and called ‘positive affect’, ‘well-being’
or ‘happiness’ (Moskowitz 2003; Ostir et al. 2000;
Pressman & Cohen 2005; Fowler & Christakis 2008).
The terms ‘content’, ‘discontent’ and ‘emotional state’
as used in this paper represent long-term states reflecting
general life satisfaction, as opposed to short-lived moods
evinced in response to stimuli. Additionally, social
networks were constructed for each subject based on
recorded information on friends, family, co-workers
and residential neighbours. For details, see the electronic
supplementary material.
We hypothesize that a neutral emotional state may act
like a susceptible state, and that content and discontent
act like ‘infected’ states (figure 1). We validate this classification using the data analysis presented below. Note that
we exclude the possibility of coinfection by both content
and discontent simultaneously, as this doubly infected
state very rarely appears in the data (see the electronic
supplementary material, figure S1). However, superinfection may be possible: individuals could potentially move
directly between being content and discontent without
passing through neutral. The data are used to validate
the model assumptions and estimate values for the parameters b, a and g. These parameters are then used to
calculate derived quantities of interest, such as the average
lifetime of an emotional infection, the probability an
infected person passes the infection to a given contact
sometime during the course of her infection, and the average frequency with which infections arise spontaneously.
Additionally, agent-based simulations are used to
compare model dynamics and clustering with the
observational data.

(d) Measuring transmission of emotions
To study the transmission of emotions, we examine
changes in emotional state between the two sequential
exams of the Framingham Heart Study in which the
CES-D was administered (exams 6 and 7). The average
fraction of the network that was classified as content or
discontent was very similar between the two exams,
suggesting the transmission process is at steady state
(exam 6: 65% content, 9% discontent; exam 7: 62%
content, 9% discontent). Additionally, these exams
were closely and consistently spaced (Dt ¼ 3+1 year).
We include only subjects who answered all questions on
the CES-D in both exams.
Subjects were initially classified as first as either ‘content’ or ‘not content’, and then separately as
‘discontent’ or ‘not discontent’. Individuals who are
neither ‘content’ nor ‘discontent’ are classified as ‘neutral’. As expected, very few people who are classified
as ‘content’ are also classified as ‘discontent’ (less than
1/1000). Thus we have three possible emotional states. A

states in included in the electronic supplementary material,

A given state x is considered infectious if having more
contacts in state x makes you more likely to switch to
state x. That is, a positive relationship between the
number of contacts in state x and the probability to

A. L. Hill et al. Infectious emotions in a social network

transition from state y to state x indicates that state x is
infectious with respect to state y. Therefore, to test
whether a given state x is infectious with respect to
another state y, we perform an ordinary least squares
(OLS) linear regression as follows. Each subject in state
y in exam 6 is coded as either having transitioned
to state x (transition ¼ 1) or not (transition ¼ 0) in
exam 7. We then regress this binary transition variable
for each subject against that subject’s number of contacts
in state x during exam 6. A significant positive correlation
indicates that having more friends in state x at the earlier
exam makes you more likely to switch to state x in the
later exam. If state x is infectious (a significant positive
correlation exists), then the value of b can be calculated
from the slope of the regression line, and the value of a
can be calculated from the intercept. If state x is not infectious (no significant correlation exists), then the value of g
can be calculated from the intercept. Dt was taken as the
average time between examinations, which was 2.5 years.
Using logistic regression as opposed to OLS regression
gives very similar results, as the datapoint line is within
the linear range of the logistic model.
It is important for our analysis that subjects do not
change emotional states rapidly (days or weeks), but
instead on the timescale of years or longer. While the
CES-D asks subjects to evaluate feelings in the last
week, it is known to be a reliable measure of long-term
emotions, as opposed to short-lived moods evinced in
response to stimuli. Several studies have shown that
CES-D scale scores to be stable for up to 12 months,
with high intra-individual test– retest correlations
(Radloff 1977; Roberts 1980). Furthermore, we find a
strong positive correlation between each subject’s
emotional state in the two measurement periods (r ¼
0.47). This suggests that emotional states are not
fluctuating on the timescale of weeks or months, but
rather on the timescale at which we are measuring: if
they were changing faster than 3 –5 years, then a subject’s
state in exam 6 would not be strongly predictive of her
state in exam 7. Note that this correlation is also confirmed by a more detailed analysis (Fowler & Christakis
2008). Thus, there is strong evidence that the emotions
we are measuring change only on the timescale we are
measuring, as opposed to fluctuating much more rapidly.
Our epidemiological approach to social contagion has
important differences from other models which look at correlations in present and past states of connected individuals
(Christakis & Fowler 2007, 2008; Fowler & Christakis
2008). Here, we look at how contacts influence the transitions between states, which better captures the nature
of contagion. Since we use pre-existing social ties, we do
not see effects from selection bias in choosing friends
with similar emotional states. Additionally, confounding
events that lead to concurrent changes in connected individuals will not show up as contagion effects in this model.

3. RESULTS
In the Framingham Heart Study network, individuals
may be connected to neighbours, co-workers, firstdegree relatives and self-nominated friends. An individual’s degree is the number of contacts that individual
has to other people in the network. Restricting to only
individuals who had been administered the CES-D at
Proc. R. Soc. B (2010)

both exams 6 and 7, and their connections that exist at
exam 6, gives a population of size n ¼ 1880, with an average degree of 3.1. The network is approximately Poisson
distributed, with a long tail, although with some subjects
having no connections. It has been previously found that
family and friends living more than 2 miles away are not
significantly associated with emotional influence (Fowler
& Christakis 2008), suggesting that face-to-face contact
is important for transmission. Thus, we restrict our analysis to connections involving only friends and relatives
living closer than 2 miles away, next-door or same address
neighbours and co-workers. With these further constraints, the degree of the network was reduced to
1.25 + 1.35.
The results of the infectiousness analysis for the spread
of content and discontent between exams 6 and 7 are
shown in figure 2. Consistent with the SISa model formulation, we find a significant positive correlation between
the probability of transitioning from neutral to content
and the number of content contacts (figure 2a, coeff. ¼
0.052, p=0.024), and no significant relationship between
the transition from content to neutral and the number of
neutral contacts (figure 2b, coeff. ¼2 0.011, p=0.59).
Additionally, we find no significant relationship between
the probability of transitioning from neutral to content
and the number of neutral contacts (coeff. ¼ 0.48,
p ¼ 0.10), or the probability of transitioning from
content to neutral and the number of content contacts
(coeff. ¼ 0.22, p ¼ 0.98). This suggests that content
can indeed be modelled as an infectious process in the
SISa framework, with neutral susceptibles more likely to
become content infecteds with each content contact
they have. The parameters for the SISa model can be calculated from the transition probabilities using equations
mentioned previously, by dividing slope and intercept
values by Dt, the average time between exams. The
transmission rate, b, is found to be 0.02 yr21. The spontaneous infection parameter a is found to be 0.18 yr21.
The recovery parameter g is found to be 0.088 yr21.
These results are dependent on restricting analysis to
contacts who had exams separated by less than threeand-a-half years (75%). For longer times it becomes
increasingly probable that more than one transition has
been made between exams.
We now repeat this analysis for discontent. We find that
discontent can be also described in the SISa framework as
a contagious emotion with neutral as the susceptible state.
The probability of transitioning from neutral to discontent
is positively correlated with the number of discontent contacts (figure 2c, coeff. ¼ 0.097, p ¼ 0.027), and the
probability of transitioning from discontent back to neutral
is independent of the number of neutral contacts
(figure 2d, coeff. ¼ 0.032, p ¼ 0.56). Additionally, we
find no significant relationship between the probability of
transitioning from neutral to discontent and the number
of neutral contacts (coeff. ¼ 0.11, p ¼ 0.75), or the probability of transitioning from discontent to neutral and the
number of discontent contacts (coeff ¼ 0.002, p ¼ 0.99).
The model parameters are b ¼ 0.04 yr21, a ¼ 0.040 yr21,
g ¼ 0.13 yr21. Interestingly, the rate of transmission
through a contact is similar for both content and discontent, while the rate of spontaneous infection is much
larger for content and the rate of recovery is larger for
discontent.

Figure 2. Both content and discontent behave like disease agents, infecting those in a susceptible neutral emotional state. (a)
Becoming content: the probability of transitioning from neutral to content increases in the number of content contacts (slope ¼
0.052, p ¼ 0.024, intercept ¼ 0.42). (b) Recovering from content: the probability of recovering from content to the neutral state
does not depend on the number of neutral contacts (slope ¼ 20.011, p ¼ 0.59, intercept ¼ 0.22). (c) Becoming discontent: the
probability of transitioning from neutral to discontent increases in the number of discontent contacts (slope ¼ 0.097, p ¼ 0.027,
intercept ¼ 0.095). (d) Recovering from discontent: the probability of recovering from discontent to the neutral state does not
depend on the number of neutral contacts (slope ¼ 0.032, p ¼ 0.56, intercept ¼ 0.32). Error bars represent the standard error of
the mean, and labels are the number of individuals averaged for each data point. We also find no significant dependence of
these transitions on age, sex or education ((a): age, coeff ¼ 0.0014, p ¼ 0.52; education, coeff ¼ 0.0024, p ¼ 0.81; sex,
coeff ¼ 20.0074, p ¼ 0.87. (b): age, coeff ¼ 0.0016, p ¼ 0.21; education, coeff ¼ 20.0095, p ¼ 0.08; sex, coeff ¼ 0.0109,
p ¼ 0.64. (c): age, coeff ¼ 0.0001, p ¼ 0.93; education, coeff ¼ 0.0008, p ¼ 0.90; sex, coeff ¼ 0.0485, p ¼ 0.08. (d): age,
coeff ¼ 20.0006, p ¼ 0.88; education, coeff ¼ 20.0165, p ¼ 0.35; sex, coeff ¼ 20.024, p ¼ 0.77).

We also include for the possibility of direct transitions
between content and discontent (‘superinfection’), which
are sometimes observed. We calculate the rate of direct
transitions from content to discontent to be scd ¼
(0.009 + 0.003) per year and the rate from discontent
to content to be sdc ¼ (0.07 + 0.02) per year. See the
electronic supplementary material for details. The estimated rates of all transitions are visualized in figure 3.
From the SISa model parameter estimates, various
quantities of interest can be calculated. The average lifetime of an emotional state is the average length of time
an individual spends in this state before recovering. For
both content and discontent, ‘recovering’ usually means
going to the neutral state (gc or gd), but also includes
the possibility of transitioning directly to the other
‘infected state’ (scd or sdc). The total recovery rate (gT)
is the sum of both these rates. The average lifetime of a
contentment infection is 10.1 years, and for discontentment it is 5.0 years. Thus, the average contentment
infection appears to last twice as long as the average discontentment episode. The ‘influence’ of an emotion is
the cumulative probability that the infection will be
passed from an infected to a susceptible connection
before the infected individual recovers. This is calculated
as 1 2 e2b/gT ’ b/gT. For both content and discontent,
this value is 0.18. The ‘cycle length’ is the average
length of time between spontaneous infections, and is

Figure 3. Parameter estimates for content and discontent using

also some ‘superinfection’ present: direct transitions between
content and discontent. ac (ad) ¼ rate of spontaneously becoming content (discontent), gc (gd) ¼ rate of recovery from

5.6 years for content and 25 years for discontent. This
suggests that an individual may spontaneously become
content many times throughout life.
In the regular SIS or SIR models, the average number
of secondary infections caused before recovery is called
the basic reproductive ratio, R0. An epidemic only occurs
for R0 . 1. In the SISa model, there is no thresholding
behaviour as seen in traditional models, because of
the spontaneous infection term. Even if there are no
individuals initially infected and no contagion (b ¼ 0),
spontaneous infection will nonetheless lead to a nonzero steady-state level of infected. In the absence of
spontaneous infection, the effective R0 can be estimated
as bn/g, where n is the average degree. For content, R0
is 0.28 and for discontent it is 0.39. Since for both R0 is
less than one, self-sustained epidemics of either emotion
could not be sustained if people did not become
spontaneously infected.
We also perform further analysis to examine differences in local network structure for individuals in
different emotional states. Content individuals have on
average 1.26 connections to other people in the data,
neutral individuals 1.37 connections and discontent
individuals 0.97 connections. The smaller number of
connections among discontent individuals suggests isolation, which could be contributing to or secondary to
depressive symptoms. We can also ask whether people
in a given state tend to cluster. Clustering is a measure
of the spatial correlation (in the network sense) between
individuals in the same emotional state. Clustering is
defined as the ratio of the observed number of connections between two types of individuals to the number of
connections expected if the positioning of individuals in
the network was random. Clustering of like individuals
can be caused by an infective process spreading within a
network (Keeling 1999), but may also be caused by confounding environmental factors influencing behaviour, or
selection of contacts based on similar behaviour. In a
purely infectious process on a network, the average correlation between two infected individuals will be greater
than one, and the average correlation between an infected
and a susceptible individual will be less than one. To compare observed clustering to that expected from a pure
infection, we perform agent-based simulations of SISa
epidemics on networks with the FHS network topology
and calculate the predicted clustering (table 1). For content, there is good agreement between observed and
predicted clustering, suggesting that the inductive
spread of content can explain the observed clustering of
content individuals. For discontent, however, there is
less clustering in the data than predicted by the infectious
disease simulations. Thus discontent people are more isolated in the network than predicted by the infectious
model, which is consistent with the reduced average
degree observed above. This could be explained by a
tendency for depression to cause people to interact less
with others, or for social isolation to lead to depression
(Beck & Alford 2009).

4. DISCUSSION
Here, we have shown that long-term emotional states can
spread between socially connected individuals. The transmission rate for content is found to be b ¼ 0.02 yr21,

and the spontaneous infection parameter is found to be
a ¼ 0.18 yr21, thus each content contact increases the
probability per year of becoming content by 11%.
For discontent, the rate of spontaneous infection is a ¼
0.040 yr21 and the rate of transmission is b ¼ 0.04 yr21, so
each discontent contact makes an individual 100% more
likely to become discontent each year. The average lifetime
of a contentment ‘infection’ is measured to be 10 years,
and a discontentment ‘infection’, 5 years. We have introduced a novel framework for formalizing social contagion
derived from the study of infectious diseases, which
can be used to study the spread of emotions or other
social phenomena. This infectious disease approach
has several advantages over methods which examine
correlations in behaviours of connected individuals.
Our method controls for selection bias in choosing
contacts with similar behaviour, as well as confounding
environmental factors synchronously affecting contacts.
Moreover, we find no dependence of the probability of
changing emotional state on age, sex or education,
which have been found in previous studies of content
and discontent to affect the propensity for emotions and
confound the correlations between contacts (Fowler &
Christakis 2008; Angst 1992). This lack of dependence
when we focus on transitions suggests that our approach
is more robust to variation across individuals than
previous methods.
Much of the appeal of our approach is the significance
of our results despite the great simplicity of the model
used, and the assumptions made about the dataset.
Determining the various transition rates for the model
requires the implicit assumption that all individuals are
identical in their susceptibility to various emotional
states. These rates therefore represent ensemble averages
over the population. In reality, individuals are likely to
differ in their predispositions to various emotional states.
The ability to observe transmission of emotional states
over long time frames requires some particular properties
of the Framingham Heart Study. These include large
sample sizes, longitudinal follow-up, extensive information on social contacts and various relationships,
closely and consistently spaced exams, and reliable
measures of emotions and behavioural states. This study
was not designed to study social networks or mental
health, and so there are some drawbacks that could be
improved upon in more specifically designed projects.

Infectious emotions in a social network
For example, we only examine changes between two time
points, which give us stationary values for the rates of transmission, although it is plausible that these rates themselves
change over time. Future work exploring the dynamic
spread of emotions with higher resolution data collection
is called for. This may also allow for more complex and
perhaps realistic models, such as modeling emotions as
continuous variables rather than discrete states, with transmission depending on the severity of infection.
One possible limitation of this study is the social network dataset used. We have also assumed that the social
network collected through the Framingham Heart Study
is the same as the contact network for the spread of
emotions, which is almost certainly not true given the
sparseness of the Framingham network. Because the Framingham Heart Study was not designed as a study of
social networks, no attempt was made to capture all of
a person’s important contacts. Many close friends of a
person could be missing (usually only one was recorded)
and family and co-workers who are not part of ones actual
social network may have been counted. Even if undersampling of real-world contacts did occur, it does not
change our results qualitatively: our data clearly show
that rates of becoming ‘content’ or ‘discontent’ increase
with the number of ‘infected’ contacts (i.e. are contagious) while the rates of ‘recovery’ to a ‘neutral’ state do
not depend on contacts. However, it could change the
measured rate constants. If we missed a constant
number of contacts for each person, the intercept of the
transition graphs would be shifted to the right, then the
actual a would be smaller than the a we measured. If
we missed a constant fraction of contacts for each
person, then the x-axis would be compressed and the
slope would be increased, so then the actual value of b
would be smaller than the b we measured. However,
while it is probable that the Framingham network underestimates the total number of contacts, the relationship to
the number of ‘influential’ contacts is unclear. In this
sense, the observed value of the transmission rates, b,
are network dependent. Additionally, network connections may be weighted differently according to their
ability to transmit emotions. It would be ideal to design
longitudinal study with the intent of measuring social networks and health and carefully define contacts, such as by
amount of time spent together per day, influence, etc.
A CES-D score of greater than 16 (which we defined
as ‘discontent’) can occur with major depression (94%
specific) as well as alcohol or drug dependence, anxiety,
dysthymia or bipolar disorder. Thus, it is a measure of
depressive symptoms or general distress and not necessarily clinical depression (Rush 2007; Radloff 1977).
The 10 year prevalence of all affective disorders is close
to 30 per cent (Angst 1992) which suggests that a large
portion of the population is susceptible to depressive
symptoms. This fact is consistent with our ensemble
treatment, and with the observed cycle length for discontent of 25 years. Treating discontent as a spontaneously
acquired or transmitted infection has one major drawback: it assumes that the probability of becoming
discontent is independent of an individual’s history of
depressive episodes. In reality, depression is known to
be a recurrent condition, with relative risk increasing
with history of illness (Angst et al. 2003). It has been
found that 72 per cent of people with major or minor
Proc. R. Soc. B (2010)

depression experience recurrent episodes (Kessler et al.
1997). No comparable data exist for the CES-D measurement of content, which is less routinely used. Relevant
data for comparison will probably become available as
the study of ‘positive psychology’, and especially its
relation to health (Pressman & Cohen 2005), becomes
more widespread. There have been no studies to our
knowledge which examine the lifetime or cycle of discontent or content in the general population, as defined by
the CES-D.
Our study provides evidence for a transmissive component to the dynamics of the emotions of content and
discontent. However, this dataset does not give insight
into the mechanism of infection. It is possible that displayed emotions are directly contagious (via mimicry,
pheromones, etc.), or that emotions spread indirectly,
for example by sharing some type of good fortune.
While short-term emotional states have been suggested
as a mechanism for systemically coordinating body
functions to react in the most favourable way to an
environmental stimulus, and as a means of ‘quick-anddirty’ communication of this stimulus to others (Lewis &
Haviland-Jones 2004), it is not obvious how this
argument extends to the contagion of long-term emotional states. The observed fact that ‘catching’ content and
discontent depends on social contacts, while ‘recovering’
to a neutral state does not, suggests that infection involves
a process similar to teaching a life skill that can then
persist without a constant stimulus. The mechanisms
behind the transmission of long-term emotional states
merit further study.
We have formally demonstrated that emotions can be
thought of as infectious diseases spreading across social
networks. We have introduced a novel form of mathematical infectious disease model for describing the spread of
emotions which has advantages over previous methods.
We have validated this model by studying content and discontent propagating across a large social network. Our
results give insight into the transmissive nature of positive
and negative emotions, and our model provides a theoretical framework for studying the spread of other
emotions, as well as a wide range of other social phenomena. Determining to what extent particular emotions or
behaviours are infectious is a promising direction for
further research with important implications for social
science, epidemiology and health policy.

Framingham Heart Study Dataset

In this study, we evaluate the assumption that emotions behave like infectious agents. We use data from

8

the Framingham Heart Study (Dawber, 1980) and the framework discussed above to test whether positive

9

and negative emotions fit the dynamics of an infectious disease. The Framingham study was initiated in

10

1948 in Framingham, Massachusetts and has continued enrolling subjects through the present. We exam-

11

ined individuals in the Offspring Cohort, enrolled starting in 1971. Subjects come to a central facility at

12

regular intervals (approximately every 3 years) for medical examination and collection of other survey data.

13

In additional to information on mental and physical health, subjects were asked to name at least one close

14

friend at each exam, and were also connected to all first-order relatives, coworkers, and residential neighbours.

15

16

For each subject, the following social connection data is available: (i) each other person to whom they

17

were connected, (ii) the dates of initiation and termination of that relationship, (iii) the type of relationship

18

(neighbour, coworker, first-degree relative, or friend), and (v) the geographic distance between the two sub-

19

jects. The social network for each exam was constructed by creating a network matrix G, where Gijk = 1 if

20

subject i nominated subject j as a connection before or during the time that subject i was administered exam

21

k. All relationship types are mutual except for friendships, which are self-nominated, such that Gijk 6= Gjik

22

is possible for friendships.

Individuals in the Framingham Heart Study were administered a widely validated psycho-social exam

25

called the CES-D (The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, (Radloff, 1977)) at exams 6 and

26

7 (administered on average in 1997 and 2000). The full version of this survey style exam is commonly

27

used to classify depressive symptoms (Rush, 2007; Radloff, 1977; Schroevers et al., 2000) and a subscale

28

which comprises a distinct factor (Thorson and Powell, 1993; Joseph and Lewis, 1995; Pressman and Cohen,

29

2005; Radloff and Teri, 1986; Sheehan et al., 1995) has also been validated as a measure of positive affect

30

(Moskowitz, 2003; Ostir et al., 2000; Pressman and Cohen, 2005). Similar measures of positive affect using

31

subjective surveys have been shown to be highly correlated with objective measures of well-being (Oswald

32

and Wu, 2010). We have chosen to call this positive state measured by the CES-D content, though it has

33

been called ‘happiness’ by others. It is also related to optimism and self-esteem. The negative emotion

34

measured by the full CES-D scale is generally called ‘depression’, though as described in (Rush, 2007), this

35

measure is generally agreed to represent a long-term emotional state of depressive symptomology that is

36

distinct from (and less severe than) the mental illness state of clinical depression. To prevent confusion, we

37

have called this measure discontent throughout the paper.

38

39

A content score and a discontent score were calculated for each subject from the raw responses to 20

40

multiple choice questions from the CES-D. The questions asked subjects to judge the frequency with which

41

they experienced a particular feeling or behaviour, with available answers being 0=(rarely or none of the

42

time, <1 day per week), 1=(some or a little of the time, 1-2 days per week), 2=(occasionally or a moderate

43

amount of the time, 3-4 days per week) and 3=(most of the time, 5-7 days per week). Subjects are classified

44

as content if they scored the maximum value of 3 on each of four particular questions related to positive

45

feelings. Summing the answers to the 16 CES-D questions related to negative feelings and adding inverted

46

answers to the 4 positive questions, subjects are classified as discontent if they have a total score greater

47

than 16 (out of a possible 60). Individuals who are neither content nor discontent are classified as neutral.

out of every 1000 subjects are both content and discontent, validating our classification of emotions into

50

the three states content, discontent and neutral. Figure S2B shows the number of people who made each

51

transition between the two examinations.

Figure S1. A) The distribution of subjects between four emotional states measured by the CES-D. Subjects were
classified as first as either ‘content’ or ‘not content’, and then separately as ‘discontent’ or ‘not discontent’. Individuals
who are neither ‘content’ nor ‘discontent’ are classified as ‘neutral’. As expected, very few people who are classified as
‘content’ are also classified as ‘discontent’, while those that are ‘not content’ may be ‘discontent’ or ‘not discontent’.
Fraction content=0.63, discontent=0.09, neutral=0.28. B) Each circle represents an emotional state, and the arrows
and numbers display the number of transitions that occurred between each state.

53

Super-infection: Direct transitions between content and discontent infected states

54

Figure S1B shows that direct transitions between the content and discontent states are sometimes observed.

55

There are two possibles explanations for these transitions. Firstly, because exams are only every 3 years,

56

it is possible that some of these individuals actually moved through the neutral state, and thus made two

57

transitions between observations (ie content to neutral to discontent). The second explanation is that these

58

individuals actually moved directly between these states via ‘super-infection’. We can predict how often

59

we would expect double transitions to occur within the 3 year window, based on the estimates for each

60

individual transition. These predictions are lower than the observed number of direct transitions. Thus the

61

difference between the observed and expected can be interpreted as the rate of actual direct transitions. This

62

is explained in detail below. The estimated rates of all transitions are visualized in Figure 3 in the main text.

63

64

For a Markov process, if an event occurs at a rate a, then the probability that this event has occurred

65

after a time ∆t is 1 − e−a∆t. If two events occur at rates a1 and a2 , and must occur in that sequential order,

66

then in a time period ∆t the probability that both occur is :

From this expression we can calculate the expected rate of double transitions between content and discontent (going through the neutral state) in a single time period between exams.

70

71

72

For content → discontent, the two transitions that must occur are : content to neutral (a1 = gc ) and
neutral to discontent (a2 = ad + βd nd ). There values are:

73

74

• gc = 0.088 ± 0.006 /year

75

• ad = 0.040 ± 0.006 /year

76

• βd = 0.04 ± 0.02 /year

77

For discontent → content, the two transitions that must occur are : discontent to neutral (a1 = gd ) and

78

neutral to content (a2 = ac + βc nc ). There values are:

79

80

• gd = 0.13 ± 0.02 /year

81

• ac = 0.18 ± 0.01 /year

82

• βc = 0.02 ± 0.01 /year

4

83

Using Equation 1, the expected rate of double transitions are (with standard deviations included):

84

85

• content to discontent: cexpected = (0.004 ± 0.001) + (0.004 ± 0.001) ∗ nd /year

86

• discontent to content: cexpected = (0.025 ± 0.004) + (0.003 ± 0.002) ∗ nc /year

87

Observed double transition, from Figure S2:

88

89

• content to discontent: cobserved = (0.013 ± 0.002) + (0.014 ± 0.019) ∗ nd /year

90

• discontent to content: cobserved = (0.097 ± 0.016) + (−0.0013 ± 0.043) ∗ nc /year

91

Note that the contact dependent terms for the double transition are observed to be non-significant, and

92

also expected to be overlapping with zero due to the margins of error on the calculated rates. We hence

93

ignore them for the reported rates of double transitions. The rate of direct bypass transitions is the extra

94

number of transitions that cannot be accounted for by double transitions. This is found by subtracting the

95

expected rates (cexpected ) from the observed rates (cobserved )

96

97

Rate of direct bypass transition:

98

99

• content to discontent: scd = (0.009 ± 0.003) /year

100

• discontent to content: sdc = (0.07 ± 0.02) /year

101

It is interesting to note that in Figure S1B, the number of individuals transitioning directly from content

102

to discontent is very similar to number transitioning from discontent to content. The same is true of the

103

transitions between content and neutral, and between discontent and neutral. Thus the system is in detailed

104

balance, suggesting a unique subset of the population may be responsible for the direct transitions between

105

content and discontent. For example, it could be those suffering from bipolar disease, who represent about

106

1% of the population and switch between manic and discontent episodes on the order of months.
