1. ## Meeting log of Jan 05, 2021

   ### Key points

   1.  Chris edited and polished the current outline. 

   2. The fundamentally defining feature of epi-expectation models is that individuals receive information/adopt beliefs subject to influences from sources which could be taken as **exogenous**. This differs from a wide range of models that examines mechanisms in which individual **endogenously** making choices based on their preferences on what they believe. The former framework encapsulates the following mechanisms of expectation formation. 

   - Personal experiences 
   - Social network/peer influences
   - News media
   - Experts' opinions/opinion leaders.

   3. For the purpose of the paper, we may not need to repetitively go over the basics of epidemiologic models such as SIR. It is sufficient to cite a high-quality paper on this. 
   4. This chapter/book is not just about macroeconomic expectations. More work by micro-economists need to be acknowledged. 
   5. One crucial point to be made is that purely agent-based epi models can be potentially more insightful by incorporating individual optimization choices.  

   

   ### To-do list 

   1. Find a good introduction to epidemiology modeling basics. 
   2. Making a more careful distinction between the literature on expectations based on exogenous and endogenous sources.
