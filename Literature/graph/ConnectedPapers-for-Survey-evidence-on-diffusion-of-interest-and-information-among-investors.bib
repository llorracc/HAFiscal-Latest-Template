abstract = {Abstract Questionnaire surveys of institutional and individual investors were undertaken to learn about patterns of communications. It was found that direct interpersonal communications are very important in investor decisions. Questions elicited what fraction of investors were unsystematic and allowed themselves to be influenced by word-of-mouth communications or other salient stimuli. Randomly sampled investors were studied as well as investors in stocks whose price had recently increased dramatically. Contagion or epidemic models of financial markets are proposed in which interest in individual stocks is spread by word of mouth. The survey evidence is interpreted as supporting such models.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the statistical evidence bearing on whether transitory components account for a large fraction of the variance in common stock returns. The first part treats methodological issues involved in testing for transitory return components. It demonstrates that variance ratios are among the most powerful tests for detecting mean reversion in stock prices, but that they have little power against the principal interesting alternatives to the random walk hypothesis. The second part applies variance ratio tests to market returns for the United States over the 1871-1986 period and for seventeen other countries over the 1957-1985 period, as well as to returns on individual firms over the 1926- 1985 period. We find consistent evidence that stock returns are positively serially correlated over short horizons, and negatively autocorrelated over long horizons. The point estimates suggest that the transitory components in stock prices have a standard deviation of between 15 and 25 percent and account for more than half of the variance in monthly returns. The last part of the paper discusses two possible explanations for mean reversion: time varying required returns, and slowly-decaying "price fads" that cause stock prices to deviate from fundamental values for periods of several years. We conclude that explaining observed transitory components in stock prices on the basis of movements in required returns due to risk factors is likely to be difficult.},

We utilize cross-industry stock-financed mergers and acquisitions as a source of plausibly exogenous variation in investors’ information gathering activity. In particular, we conjecture that once “endowed” with shares of the acquiring firm, target investors are more likely to study and trade in the acquirer industry; target investors also spread any newly acquired industry views to their neighbors. Tracing out the path of contagion via investors’ trading behavior, we estimate that a ten-year difference in age, a one-step difference in income, and being of different gender lowers the effective communication rate between an investor pair by 12%, 2%, and 17%, respectively. In addition, the effective communication rate from older, wealthier, female investors to their younger, poorer, male counterparts is noticeably higher than the effective communication rate in the reverse direction.},

The model assumes that changes in exponentially detrended dividends and prices are normally distributed, and that smart money investors have constant absolute risk aversion. In equilibrium, the stock price is the present value of expected dividends, discounted at the riskless interest rate, less a constant risk premium, plus a term which is due to noise trading. The model expresses both stock prices and dividends as sums of unobserved components in continuous time. The model is able to explain the volatility and predictability of U.S. stock returns in the period 1871-1986 in either of two ways. Either the discount rate is 4% or below, and the constant risk premium is large; or the discount rate is 5% or above, and noise trading, correlated with fundamentals, increases the volatility of stock prices. The data are not well able to distinguish between these explanations.},

(2) The growth of the variance of unexpected returns with the return horizon is attenuated by a discount-rate effect - shocks to expected returns generate opposite shocks to current prices. We estimate that, on average, the future price increases implied by higher expected returns are just offset by the decline in the current price. Thus, time-varying expected returns generate ‘temporary’ components of prices.},

Assuming risk-averse investors trade when they receive the news, the serial correlation of stock returns is proportional to the diffusion rate. We confirm the predicted non-linearity of the diffusion rate. Focusing on very large stocks where liquidity is less of an issue, we decompose returns into a component based on earnings releases (public news) and a residual (private news). The serial correlation of a return due to public news with future returns declines in time. In contrast, the serial correlation of a return due to private news with future returns initially increases and only then decreases in time.},

abstract = {Using a high‐stakes field experiment conducted with a financial brokerage, we implement a novel design to separately identify two channels of social influence in financial decisions, both widely studied theoretically. When someone purchases an asset, his peers may also want to purchase it, both because they learn from his choice (“social learning”) and because his possession of the asset directly affects others' utility of owning the same asset (“social utility”). We randomize whether one member of a peer pair who chose to purchase an asset has that choice implemented, thus randomizing his ability to possess the asset. Then, we randomize whether the second member of the pair: (i) receives no information about the first member, or (ii) is informed of the first member's desire to purchase the asset and the result of the randomization that determined possession. This allows us to estimate the effects of learning plus possession, and learning alone, relative to a (no information) control group. We find that both social learning and social utility channels have statistically and economically significant effects on investment decisions. Evidence from a follow‐up survey reveals that social learning effects are greatest when the first (second) investor is financially sophisticated (financially unsophisticated); investors report updating their beliefs about asset quality after learning about their peer's revealed preference; and, they report motivations consistent with “keeping up with the Joneses” when learning about their peer's possession of the asset. These results can help shed light on the mechanisms underlying herding behavior in financial markets and peer effects in consumption and investment decisions.},

The tests are conducted using the capital asset pricing model to estimate relative returns.

abstract = {I f the efficient markets hypothesis was a publicly traded security, its price would be enormously volatile. Following Samuelson's (1965) proof that stock prices should follow a random walk if rational competitive investors require a fixed rate of return and Fama's (1965) demonstration that stock prices are indeed close to a random walk, stock in the efficient markets hypothesis rallied. Michael Jensen was able to write in 1978 that "the efficient markets hypothesis is the best established fact in all of social sciences." Such strong statements portend reversals, the efficient markets hypothesis itself notwithstanding. Stock in the efficient markets hypothesis lost ground rapidly following the publication of Shiller's (1981) and Leroy and Porter's (1981) volatility tests, both of which found stock market volatility to be far greater than could be justified by changes in dividends. The stock snapped back following the papers of Kleidon (1986) and Marsh and Merton (1986) which challenged the statistical validity of volatility tests. A choppy period then ensued, where conflicting econometric studies induced few of the changes in opinion that are necessary to move prices. But the stock in the efficient markets hypothesis-at least as it has traditionally been formulated-crashed along with the rest of the market on October 19, 1987. Its recovery has been less dramatic than that of the rest of the market. This paper reviews an alternative to the efficient markets approach that we and others have recently pursued. Our approach rests on two assumptions. First, some investors are not fully rational and their demand for risky assets is affected by their beliefs or sentiments that are not fully justified by fundamental news. Second,},

We are able to make this identification by exploiting a unique feature of individual brokerage accounts in the People's Republic of China. The data allow us to pinpoint an investor's location at the time he or she places a trade. Our results are consistent with a simple, rational expectations model of heterogeneously informed investors.

abstract = {This paper analyzes a randomized experiment to shed light on the role of information and social interactions in employees' decisions to enroll in a Tax Deferred Account (TDA) retirement plan within a large university. The experiment encouraged a random sample of employees in a subset of departments to attend a benefits information fair organized by the university, by promising a monetary reward for attendance. The experiment multiplied by more than five the attendance rate of these treated individuals (relative to controls), and tripled that of untreated individuals within departments where some individuals were treated. TDA enrollment five and eleven months after the fair was significantly higher in departments where some individuals were treated than in departments where nobody was treated. However, the effect on TDA enrollment is almost as large for individuals in treated departments who did not receive the encouragement as for those who did. We provide three interpretations-differential treatment effects, social network effects, and motivational reward effects-to account for these results.},

First, we consider macroeconomic news and show that it is difficult to explain more than one third of the return variance from this source. Second, to explore the possibility that the stock market responds to information that is omitted from our specifications, we also examine market moves coincident with major political and world events. The relatively small market responses to such news, along with evidence that large market moves often occur on days without any identifiable major news releases, casts doubt on the view that stock price movements are fully explicable by news about future cash flows and discount rates.},

This practice may introduce a look-ahead bias and an ex-post-selection bias into the study. We examine this problem by comparing results from the standard COMPUSTAT data base with those from a data base which suffers from neither bias. We find that rates of return from portfolios chosen on the basis of accounting data from the two data bases differ significantly. Further, we find that these differences imply different conclusions when we test a specific hypothesis relating accounting and price data. Finally, we propose a number of remedies which may reduce the bias when the standard COMPUSTAT data base is used.},

abstract = {A survey compared speculative behavior in two groups of institutional investors. The "experimental" group held stocks that had shown extraordinary price increases over the preceding year that also had high price earnings ratios. The control group held randomly selected stocks. In Shiller and Pound [1986] we argued that the survey results gave some support to some diffusion or epidemic models for interest in the stocks in the experimental group. Here, we show that the two groups are similar in describing their investment strategy as relating to a theory about fundamental value rather than about the kind of stocks that are becoming attractive to investors. However, the experimental group is less likely to make explicit comparisons of price with measures of fundamental value, and differs from the control group in their attitudes toward timing, price changes, and short-term earnings disappointment. Overall, these results appear consistent with the notion that price changes unrelated to fundamentals may be caused by contagious enthusiasm about fundamentals amongst institutional investors. The holding patterns of those experimental group investors who said that they were unsystematic in their stock choice are studied. These investors tended to show gradually increasing holdings over the period of stock price increase. Reasons respondents gave for the gradual increase are discussed.},

This suggests a role for some nonstandard models for expected returns. One possibility is "fads" models in which noise trading by naive investors is important. At present, however, there is little direct evidence that such fads play a significant role in stock price determination. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

The analysis is conducted in a log-linear structural VAR framework. I find that about half of the yearly variation in prices is not related to either earnings or dividend changes. Time-varying interest rates do not help explain the remaining price movements. However, time-varying excess stock returns (i.e., risk premiums) account for much of the remaining variation in stock prices, in particular, in the postwar period. As a result, the deviation of stock prices from these fundamentals reduces to about 10% of stock price movements and tends to persist for a while before it declines eventually. This finding seems more compatible with a fad rather than a bubble interpretation.},

We assess efficiency in each market by employing the VAR methodology of Campbell and Shiller (Campbell, J.Y., Shiller, R.J., 1988b. The dividend–price ratio and expectations of future dividends and discount factors. Rev. Financ. Stud. 1, 195–228) and adopting two alternative assumptions regarding equilibrium expected returns. The first model assumes that equilibrium expected excess returns are constant, while the second model assumes that equilibrium returns depend upon a time varying risk premium which varies with the conditional expectation of the return variance (i.e. the CAPM). We find that the model which assumes constant excess returns is clearly rejected for both France and Germany. However, the volatility (CAPM) model provides some evidence for efficiency.},

abstract = {This paper provides direct evidence of a causal link between the stock market participation of individuals and that of the other members of the community in which they reside. We first establish the presence of a robust positive correlation between the probability that an individual owns stock and the level of stock market participation of one's community, as measured by reporting dividend income on tax returns. We also show that conditional on owning stock, an individual is likely to own more (relative to income) when community ownership is higher. These results are robust to a wide range of individual and community controls, including measures of the importance of local firms (which have large independent effects), and specification checks to ensure that the relation is not driven solely by ownership of stock of one's employer. We then provide evidence that this community effect is at least partially driven by word of mouth by showing that the effect is stronger in more sociable communities. To demonstrate causality, we employ a novel instrumental variables strategy that uses the stock ownership rates of the non-local parents of one's local peers to instrument for community ownership. Further, we also control for heterogeneity in risk preferences by including individual-level fixed effects. We conclude that a ten percentage-point increase in equity market participation of the members of one's community makes it four to five percentage points more like the individual will invest in stocks. We also provide estimates of a direct parental effect, as well as suggestive evidence that one's home state may have lasting effects on one's stock market participation.},
