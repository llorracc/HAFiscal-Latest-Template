Social Interaction and Stock-Market
Participation
HARRISON HONG, JEFFREY D. KUBIK, and JEREMY C. STEIN∗

ABSTRACT
We propose that stock-market participation is inf luenced by social interaction. In our
model, any given “social” investor finds the market more attractive when more of his
peers participate. We test this theory using data from the Health and Retirement
Study, and find that social households—those who interact with their neighbors, or
attend church—are substantially more likely to invest in the market than non-social
households, controlling for wealth, race, education, and risk tolerance. Moreover, consistent with a peer-effects story, the impact of sociability is stronger in states where
stock-market participation rates are higher.

IN 1998, 48.9 PERCENT OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS owned stock, either directly, or
through mutual funds or various retirement vehicles such as 401(k) plans or
IRAs.1 While this number may appear low in an absolute sense—particularly
in light of the historically high returns to investing in the stock market—it
actually represents an all-time peak in the United States, and a dramatic increase from prior years. For example, less than a decade earlier, in 1989, the
participation rate stood at only 31.6 percent; even as late as 1995 it was at just
40.4 percent.
What are the underlying determinants of the stock-market participation
rate? This question is an important one, for a number of reasons. First, as
argued by, for example, Mankiw and Zeldes (1991), Heaton and Lucas (1999),
Vissing-Jorgensen (1999), and Brav, Constantinides, and Gezcy (2002), the participation rate can have a direct effect on the equity premium; thus an understanding of what drives participation can help shed light on the equity-premium
puzzle of Mehra and Prescott (1985).
Second, certain policy debates hinge crucially on one’s view of why so many
households opt not to participate in the stock market. Consider proposals which
would have the government invest some portion of social security tax proceeds

in the stock market. On the one hand, if one takes the perspective of a fullinformation, frictionless model with optimizing households—in which those
who sit out do so simply because they find the market’s risk-return profile
unattractive—standard arguments suggest that there is nothing to be gained
by having the government invest in the market on their behalf. On the other
hand, if households do not participate because of a lack of information about
market opportunities, or because other frictional costs deter them from doing so, the case for these proposals can, at a minimum, begin to make logical
sense.2
A few basic facts about the determinants of household participation in the
stock market are already well known.3 First, participation is strongly increasing in wealth. This can be understood by thinking of participation as involving
fixed costs; wealthier households have more to invest, and so the fixed cost is
less of a deterrent to them. Vissing-Jorgensen (2000) builds a model in which
fixed costs of participation are incurred on a per-period basis, and estimates
that such costs have to be on the order of $200 per year to explain observed
participation rates. Of course, such large numbers beg the questions of what
these black-box fixed costs actually represent, and whether one should think
of them as being similar across different types of households.
Stock-market participation has also been found to be increasing in household education. One interpretation is that education reduces the fixed costs
of participating, by making it easier for would-be investors to understand the
market’s risk–reward trade-offs, to deal with the mechanics of setting up an
account, and executing trades, etc.4 Finally, there is also a pronounced link
between race and participation, with white, non-Hispanic households having
much higher participation rates, controlling for wealth and education.
In this paper, we add to this line of work by considering the possibility that
stock-market participation is inf luenced by social interaction. A priori, this
would seem to be a promising hypothesis, given the growing body of empirical research that speaks to the importance of peer-group effects in a variety
of other contexts.5 Notably, some of this work finds evidence of peer effects in
financial settings that are suggestively close to the one we have in mind—
for example, Madrian and Shea (2000) and Duf lo and Saez (2002) demonstrate that an individual’s decision of whether or not to participate in particular employer-sponsored retirement plans is inf luenced by the choices of his
co-workers.

Bernheim and Garrett (1996) and Bayer, Bernheim, and Scholz (1998) find that financial education in the workplace increases participation in retirement plans.

Social Interaction and Stock-Market Participation

139

In the specific setting of the stock market, there are at least two broad
channels through which social interaction might inf luence participation. The
first is word-of-mouth or observational learning (Banerjee (1992), Bikchandani,
Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992), Ellison and Fudenberg (1993, 1995)).6 For example, potential investors may learn from one another either about the high
returns that the market has historically offered, or about how to execute trades.
Second, in the spirit of Becker (1991), a stock-market participant may get pleasure from talking about the ups and downs of the market with friends who are
also fellow participants, much as he might enjoy similar conversations about
restaurants, books, movies, or local sports teams in which there is a shared
interest.
We develop a model that captures these ideas in a simple way. Our model
has two types of investors: (1) “non-socials” and (2) “socials.” The non-socials
are similar to the investors in Vissing-Jorgensen (2000): They each face fixed
costs of participation, but these fixed costs are not inf luenced by the behavior
of others. In contrast, any given social investor finds it more attractive to invest
in the market—that is, his fixed costs are lower—when the participation rate
among his peers is higher.
The model’s most basic and unambiguous prediction is that there will be
higher participation rates among social investors than among non-socials, all
else being equal. The model also suggests that the participation rate among
socials can be more sensitive to changes in other exogenous parameters—that
is, there can be “social multiplier” effects. Consider the consequences of a change
in technology (e.g., web-based trading) that makes the direct physical costs of
participation lower for all investors. In many cases, this technological change
will have a greater impact on the participation of socials than on that of nonsocials because of the positive externalities that socials confer on one another.
Indeed, when these positive externalities are strong enough, they can generate
multiple equilibria among social investors.
In an effort to test the theory, we draw on data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). This survey of roughly 7,500 households has a variety of
information on wealth, asset holdings, demographics, etc. But most relevant
for our purposes, it also asks respondents several questions which allow us
to create empirical analogs to our model’s notion of “non-social” and “social”
households. In particular, the survey asks whether households interact with
their neighbors, or attend church.
We find that more social households—defined as those who answer “yes” to
these questions—are indeed more likely to invest in the stock market, controlling for other factors like wealth, race, and education. The effects of sociability
are both strongly statistically significant, as well as economically important.
6
See also Routledge (1999) and DeMarzo, Vayanos, and Zwiebel (2001) for other models of learning in financial markets. Shiller and Pound (1989) present survey data on the diffusion of information among stock-market investors by word-of-mouth. Kelly and Grada (2000) find evidence that,
during banking panics, bad news about banks spreads via word-of-mouth in neighborhoods.

Across the entire sample, households that either know their neighbors or attend church have roughly a 4 percent higher probability of participating in the
stock market, all else being equal. Among white, educated households with
above-average wealth—those who are typically most likely to be on the cusp
of the participation decision—the marginal effect of sociability is substantially
stronger, reaching 8 percent in some specifications.
While the HRS data allow us to address our theory in a straightforward way,
they also suffer from an important drawback. The measures of sociability that
we take from the HRS—whether households know their neighbors or attend
church—ref lect endogenous choices, and hence may capture information not
just about the degree of social interaction per se, but also about other personality
traits that may be associated with the propensity to invest in the stock market.
For example, sociable people may be more bold, and hence less risk-averse when
it comes to investing. Or they may be more optimistic, and hence have higher
expectations for future stock-market returns.
We attempt to address these possibilities in two ways. First, we are fortunate
in that the HRS data allow us to construct proxies for other potentially relevant
personality traits such as risk tolerance and optimism. When entered as additional controls in the stock-market participation regressions, these proxies tend
to come in significantly, and with the expected signs—suggesting that they are
doing a good job of measuring what they are supposed to measure—but they
have little effect on our sociability variables.
Second, we take advantage of the fact that our theory has further implications
that are not shared by the alternative hypothesis that sociability is a surrogate
for personality. In particular, if social households invest more because of their
interactions with other investors, then the marginal effect of sociability ought
to be more pronounced in areas where there is a high density of stock-market
participants.7 To take an extreme example, if a social household lives in a state
where nobody else invests in the stock market (and it does not interact with
anybody out-of-state) then according to our theory we should not see any effect of
sociability on participation for this household. In contrast, if our social variables
are simply proxies for, for example, individual risk tolerance, then one might
expect these variables to attract the same positive coefficients in participation
regressions regardless of what kind of state the household lives in.
Consistent with our theory, we document that the impact of household sociability is indeed stronger in states where stock-market participation rates are
higher. The cross-state differentials are very substantial. In “high-participation”
states (those with average participation rates in the top one-third of the sample)
sociability generates an increase in the participation rate that averages roughly
7 to 9 percent across all demographic groups; in “low-participation” states the
sociability effect is close to zero. Moreover, this cross-state pattern distinguishes
our social variables from our measure of risk-tolerance—the risk-tolerance
7
This logic parallels that of Bertrand, Luttmer, and Mullainathan (2000), who find that being
surrounded by others who speak the same language increases welfare use more for those from
high-welfare-using groups.

variable shows no differential effect across states. These results help to allay concerns that our proxies for sociability are picking up other personality
attributes that have nothing to do with social interaction.8
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin in Section I
by discussing a model that illustrates the link between social interaction and
stock market participation, and that forms the basis for our subsequent tests. In
Section II, we describe our data set, and in Section III we present our empirical
results. Section IV concludes.
I. The Model
The key implications of our model can be sketched verbally. For a more formal treatment, see our NBER working paper (Hong, Kubik, and Stein (2001)).
We distinguish between two classes of investors: (1) non-socials and (2) socials.
Each non-social investor faces a fixed cost of participating in the market. This
cost can have both an idiosyncratic component (e.g., the investor has a difficult time understanding financial matters), as well as a common component
(e.g., the investor lives in an area where there are few brokerage offices per
capita). But importantly, for a non-social investor, the fixed cost is unrelated to
the participation decisions of all other investors. Consequently, each non-social
investor makes his participation decision independently, by trading off the benefits of participation—which will typically be increasing in wealth—against the
fixed cost.9
Social investors differ from non-socials in that their net cost of participating
in the market is inf luenced by the choices of their peers. Specifically, the cost for
any social investor in a given peer group is reduced—relative to the value for an
otherwise identical non-social—by an amount that is increasing in the number
of others in the peer group that are participating. Or said differently, any one
social finds it more attractive to participate in the market when more of his
peers do. In the limiting case where none of a social’s peers are participating,
he faces the same fixed cost as an otherwise identical non-social.
As noted earlier, there are several concrete interpretations that can be attached to this formulation. And depending on the specific story being told, the
actual social interaction may take place either before or after the decision to
participate in the market is made. For example, in the case of word-of-mouth
8

There is a more subtle version of the endogeneity critique that we cannot address. It may
be, for example, that socials have a higher participation rate not because they have a greater
number of informative interactions with their peers, but rather because they are better listeners
and hence learn more from a given level of interaction. Thus one cannot draw the same kind of causal
conclusions that one might from a randomized experiment (as in Sacerdote (2001)). Specifically, it
does not follow from our results that if a non-social household were somehow forced to spend more
time with its neighbors it would be more likely to participate in the market. We do not think this
caveat makes our findings less interesting from a positive-economics perspective. But it matters
when thinking about their normative implications.
9
In our NBER working paper, we show that in a constant-relative-risk-aversion (CRRA) framework the benefit to participating in the market is simply a fixed proportion of initial wealth.

learning about the market’s risk/return characteristics, the interaction takes
place before any investment. However, in the case of getting utility from talking with friends about the market, one can imagine that a social would invest
based just on the prospect of future interactions.
This set-up leads to the following three implications. First, controlling for
wealth, risk tolerance, and measures of participation costs, we should see a
higher participation rate among social investors than among non-socials. Second, there will be social multiplier effects with respect to changes in exogenous
parameters like wealth, risk tolerance, and participation costs. That is, the participation rate for socials should respond more sensitively to changes in these
parameters than the participation rate for non-socials. And third, our model
admits the possibility of multiple equilibria among social investors. When the
positive externalities across members of a peer group are strong enough, either
a relatively high or relatively low participation rate can be self-sustaining.
In the empirical work below, much of our focus will be on testing the first
of these three implications—that socials have a higher participation rate than
non-socials—and on ensuring that the results of these tests are not contaminated by endogeneity biases. Nevertheless, it is worth brief ly highlighting how
the model’s implications for social multipliers and multiple equilibria might
manifest themselves in the data.
The notion of social multipliers may be especially helpful in thinking about
changes in aggregate stock-market participation over time. As noted above,
the participation rate has increased dramatically over the last decade or so.
One candidate explanation for this phenomenon is that the growing prominence of mutual funds, along with the introduction of web-based trading, have
together led to a systematic decline in average costs of participation.10 If so,
social-interaction effects may have helped to give this cost shock much more
kick than it otherwise would have had. This hypothesis can in principle be
tested by looking to see if the participation rate of socials has increased more
rapidly in recent years than has the participation rate of non-socials. We make
an effort in this direction, though data limitations prevent us from going as far
as we would like.
To the extent that people tend to interact disproportionately with members
of their own racial/ethnic groups, the multiple-equilibrium feature of the model
could potentially shed some light on the puzzle of why black and Hispanic
households tend to be stuck at much lower participation rates, even when they
are wealthy and highly educated. Loosely speaking, the multiple equilibria suggest that an ethnic group’s past history with respect to participation may—by
affecting which equilibrium is chosen—exert an important inf luence on current outcomes, above and beyond the effects of any current conditions such as
wealth and education.11
10
Choi, Laibson, and Metrick (2002) present direct evidence on the consequences of web-based
trading.
11
With regard to the role of history, Chiteji, and Stafford (1999) document that young adults are
much more likely to participate in the stock market if their parents did.

II. Data
Our data come from Health and Retirement Study (HRS) administered by
the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan.12 This survey
was first conducted in 1992 (this is referred to as Wave 1 of the survey), and
covers approximately 7,500 households who have a member born during the
period 1931 through 1941.13 Thus the average age of target respondents at
the time of Wave 1 is roughly 56 years. Follow-up Waves 2, 3, and 4, covering
the same households, were conducted in 1994, 1996, and 1998, respectively.
Our analysis focuses primarily on the data from Wave 1 of the HRS. We have
re-run all our tests using the data from the later waves; as might be expected,
given that these later waves cover the same households, they contain very little
independent information, and lead to virtually identical results.14
Beginning in 1998, the HRS also added a new cohort to the survey, composed
of households with a member born during the period 1942 through 1947, and
dubbed the “war-baby” cohort. The average age of the war babies in 1998 is
approximately 54 years, very similar to that of the original HRS sample in 1992.
This 1998 war-baby sample is of obvious interest, for two reasons. First, we
would like some out-of-sample verification of our results from the 1992 survey.
And second, it would be interesting to test the model’s intertemporal socialmultiplier prediction—to see if, as the overall participation rate has increased
over the 1990s, the differential between socials and non-socials has widened.
Unfortunately, the war-baby sample is much smaller, covering only around
1,400 households, which seriously limits our statistical power. Even more problematic, this version of the survey omits several of the questions that are most
crucial for us, leaving us able to create only one of the three measures of social
interaction that we use in the original 1992 HRS sample, and forcing us to
drop other controls. Thus our analysis of the war-baby sample is restricted to
just a couple of very basic regressions; unless explicitly noted otherwise, everything else we discuss from now on refers to the 1992 wave of the original HRS
sample.
The HRS includes information on place of residence (by state, along with
an urban/rural indicator), age, years of education, race, wealth, income, and
marital status. For age, years of education, and race, we may have two responses
per household—one for the man and one for the woman of the house. We take
the “age” and “education” of a household to be the higher of the two values. For
race, we classify a household as non-white if either member is.15 With respect
to stock-market participation, the survey asks whether households own stocks,
12

The data set, along with all the survey questions and supporting documentation, is available
at: www.umich.edu/∼hrswww/.
13
The HRS is a representative sample within this age group, except that blacks, Hispanics, and
Florida residents are 100 percent oversampled.
14
One reason to focus on the first (1992) wave is that there is some attrition among respondents
in the later follow-up surveys. (The first-wave interviews are done in person, the others by phone.)
Moreover, the rate of attrition is correlated with our key variables—there is more attrition among
non-social households.
15
None of our results is sensitive to how we choose to handle these details.

either directly or through mutual funds. However, it should be noted that this
question only pertains to non-retirement-account assets. The data set has very
little information on assets held in retirement accounts, so these are omitted
in our measure of participation. While there is no reason to expect that this
should bias our inferences about the role of social interactions, it does mean
that the average participation rates that we report are significantly lower than
those obtained from other data sets (e.g., the Survey of Consumer Finances)
that include retirement assets.
To create our measures of social interaction, we focus on three questions in
the survey. A single member of the household, typically the woman, answers
each of these questions.16 The first is: “Of your closest neighbors, how many do
you know?,” to which 92.9 percent of respondents answer either “all,” “most,”
or “some.” Our Know Neighbors dummy variable takes on the value one for
these households, and zero for the remainder who answer “none.” The second
question is: “How often do you visit with your neighbors?,” to which 63.9 percent
of respondents answer either “daily,” “several times a week,” “several times a
month,” or “several times a year.” Our Visit Neighbors dummy is set to one for
these households, and to zero for the remainder who answer “hardly ever.”17
Finally, the third question is: “How often do you attend religious services?,”
to which 76.0 percent of respondents answer either “more than once a week,”
“once a week,” “two or three times a month,” or “one or more times a year.” Our
Attend Church dummy is one for these households, and zero for the remainder
who answer “never.”
A large body of work in sociology supports the premise of using these sorts
of variables as measures of the extent to which households have informative
interactions with one another. Granovetter (1983) surveys much of this work,
emphasizing “the strength of weak ties”—that is, the substantial amount of
information that people obtain through interactions with neighbors and casual
acquaintances. For example, there is a lot of evidence to the effect that people
learn about new jobs through such informal connections, rather than through
more formal channels.18
As mentioned above, we also use the survey questions to create proxies for
other personality traits. Risk aversion is the most straightforward, since there is
a question designed by Barsky et al. (1997, page 540) to measure this attribute:
“. . . you are given the opportunity to take a new and equally good job, with a
50-50 chance it will double your (family) income and a 50-50 chance it will cut
your (family) income by a third. Would you take that new job?” In contrast to
16

In our regressions, we include a dummy for the sex of the respondent to the social questions.
We are bypassing another similar question, “Do you have good friends in your neighborhood?”
because it seems more ambiguous as a measure of social interaction. In particular, we worry that a
respondent who interacts regularly with his or her neighbors, but whose best friends live elsewhere,
might be inclined to say “no” to this question.
18
The work surveyed in Granovetter (1983) is more directly applicable to the interpretation of
our model in which socials communicate real information about the stock market to one another. It
has less to say about the interpretation in which socials simply derive utility from investing when
their friends invest.
17

Social Interaction and Stock-Market Participation

145

the sociability questions, this—like the other “personality-related” questions—
is asked separately of each member of a household. Our Risk Tolerant dummy is
one for the 32.5 percent of households with at least one member who responds
“yes,” and zero for the remainder where both members answer “no.”19
Sociability might also be related to optimism, which could in turn inf luence
stock-market participation. The best we can do on this score is to use the following question: “During the past week, I felt depressed. (All or almost all of
the time, most of the time, some of the time, or none or almost none of the
time?)” Our premise is that there is likely to be a link between depression and
pessimism. In any case, our Depressed dummy takes on the value one in the 8.3
percent of cases where at least one household member responds “all or almost
all of the time;” in the remaining cases the dummy is set to zero.
It is important to stress however, that while we are using this variable in
the hopes that it will control for a purely individual characteristic—namely
pessimism—that might be related to participation, it is also plausible that it
contains further independent information about the extent of social interaction,
since depressed people may well spend less time interacting with others. In
this sense, the Depressed dummy differs from the Risk Tolerant dummy, which
seems to be more cleanly interpretable as being strictly about an individual
trait, and not about anything having to do with social interaction.
Finally, one might speculate that sociable people are simply more openminded and more willing to try new things. The only question that comes close
to allowing us to address this idea is: “How difficult is it for you to use a computer or word processor?” Our Low Tech dummy is one for the 30.9 percent
of households in which both members answer, “don’t do,” and zero for the remainder of households. An obvious problem in interpreting any coefficient on
this Low Tech variable is that unlike risk tolerance or depression, computer
use represents an outcome, not a personality trait. And as with the Depressed
dummy, there is also the qualification that even if it contains some information
about the personality trait of open-mindedness, it may also capture information
about social interaction, to the extent that there are peer effects in the adoption
of computers.
Tables I and II provide an overview of some basic facts about the data. Panel A
of Table I breaks down participation rates across different demographic groups.
Overall, in the whole HRS sample, 26.7 percent of households participate in the
stock market. (Recall that this is 1992, and that our measure of participation
does not include assets held in retirement accounts.) Participation increases
sharply with wealth, going from 3.4 percent in the lowest quintile of the wealth
distribution to 55.0 percent in the highest wealth quintile.20 There are also
19

Our results are essentially unchanged if we require both members to respond “yes” in order
to classify a household as risk-tolerant. A similar comment applies to our other personality-trait
proxies.
20
We measure wealth as the value of all assets excluding non-retirement stockholdings. With
this measure, the inter-quintile cutoff values are: $11,000; $55,000; $116,000; and $240,000. Our
principal results are unchanged if we include stockholdings in our wealth measure, and they are
also not sensitive to whether or not we include retirement wealth.

Stock-Market Participation Rates for Different Categories
of Households
The entries are the stock-market participation rates for different categories of households in the
Health and Retirement Study conducted in 1992. Stock-market participation rates pertain only
to non-retirement-account assets. Panel A reports these rates by race, education, and wealth of
households. Household wealth is defined as the value of all assets excluding non-retirement stockholdings. Panel B reports these rates by three household sociability measures (Know Neighbors,
Visit Neighbors, and Attend Church) and wealth. For Know Neighbors, households who say they
do not know neighbors are Not Social; the rest are Social. For Visit Neighbors, households who
say they do not visit neighbors are Not Social; the rest are Social. For Attend Church, households
who say they never attend church are Not Social; the rest are Social. There are 7,465 household
observations.

strong differences between white, non-Hispanic households and other racial
groups, as well as between college graduates and non-graduates. These differences remain stark even controlling for wealth. For example, in the fourth
quintile of the wealth distribution, the participation rate is 43.7 percent for
white, non-Hispanic households, and only 21.3 percent for other races. Similarly, in the same wealth quintile, the participation rate is 50.1 percent for
college graduates, and only 35.4 percent for non-graduates.
In Panel B of Table I, we take a crude first look at the effect of social interaction on participation, with a two-way sort based on wealth and each of our three
measures of sociability. Although this approach is obviously not a substitute for
the more carefully controlled regressions that follow, it makes it clear that the

The entries are summary statistics on various characteristics of households in the Health and Retirement Study conducted in 1992. Know Neighbors
equals zero for the households who say they do not know any neighbors, and one otherwise. Visit Neighbors equals zero for the households who say
they do not visit neighbors, and one otherwise. Attend Church equals zero for the households who say they never attend church, and one otherwise.
Additional household characteristics include indicator variables for whether one of the respondents is risk tolerant (Risk Tolerant), for whether the
household has one member who suffers from depression (Depressed), and for whether the household avoids using computers or word processors (Low
Tech). Other characteristics include an indicator for whether the household’s reported race is White and Non-Hispanic, Years of Education (of the most
educated person in the household), and Wealth (household wealth excluding non-retirement stockholdings). There are 7,465 household observations.

basic patterns emerge in even the simplest tabulations of the data. Using the
Know Neighbors measure of interaction, 12.3 percent of non-social households
participate in the market, while 27.8 percent of social households do. With Visit
Neighbors, the corresponding figures are 22.8 percent and 28.9 percent, while
with Attend Church they are 23.5 percent and 27.7 percent, respectively. In
addition, when the sample is stratified based on wealth, it appears that the
differences between social and non-social households become more pronounced
as wealth increases—indeed, virtually all of the action in this respect comes
from the top three wealth quintiles.
In Table II, we look at the correlations between our three measures of sociability, as well as between these measures and the other independent variables
that will enter our specifications. Not surprisingly, Know Neighbors and Visit
Neighbors are highly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.37. On the
other hand, both of these measures are more weakly correlated with Attend
Church, with coefficients of only 0.08 and 0.09, respectively. Thus it seems that
Attend Church offers relatively independent information on sociability above
and beyond that contained in the first two variables.
None of the sociability measures is all that highly correlated with the other
personality proxies, though there are some noteworthy differences. On the one
hand, Risk Tolerant is essentially uncorrelated with all the social variables.
In contrast, both Depressed and Low Tech have statistically significant correlations of −0.07 and −0.06, respectively with Know Neighbors. This suggests that
social people may indeed be happier (and perhaps more optimistic) as well as
more open to new experiences. It also reinforces the point made above, namely
that unlike the Risk Tolerant variable, Depressed and Low Tech may themselves
be proxies for the degree of social interaction.
Finally, there are some modest correlations between our sociability measures
and the demographic variables. White, educated, and wealthy households are
all somewhat more likely to both know their neighbors and visit them, with
pairwise correlation coefficients in the range of 0.04 to 0.09. On the other hand,
white households are markedly less churchgoing—the correlation between the
indicator for white/non-Hispanic and Attend Church is −0.15.
III. Empirical Results
A. Baseline Effect of Social Interaction on Stock-Market Participation
Table III presents our baseline results. All regressions are run by OLS, with
the dependent variable an indicator that takes on the value one when a household owns stock, and zero otherwise.21 There are nine columns, corresponding
to three different specifications with each of our three sociability measures—
Know Neighbors, Visit Neighbors, and Attend Church. In columns (1), (4), and
(7), the social variable enters along with the Risk Tolerant dummy, years of education, age, a white/non-Hispanic dummy, an urban dummy, a marital-status

Given the dichotomous nature of our left-hand-side variable, we have redone all our tests using
probit and logit specifications, with very similar results.

The sample comprises households in the Health and Retirement Study conducted in 1992. The dependent variable is an indicator that the household
owns stock. The independent variables are: a Sociability indicator (either Know Neighbors, Visit Neighbors, or Attend Church), Risk Tolerant indicator,
Years of Education, Age, White/Non-Hispanic indicator, an Urban indicator, Depressed indicator, Low Tech indicator, marital status dummies (not
shown), and a sex-of-respondent dummy (not shown). The specifications in columns (1), (4), and (7) include dummies for wealth quintiles. The others
include dummies for every 5 percent of the wealth distribution, and in some cases, dummies for every year of age and education, for every 5 percent of
the income distribution and for each state. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. There are 7,465 observations. (Numbers with ∗ are significant
at 10-percent level. Numbers with ∗∗ are significant at 5-percent level. Numbers with ∗∗∗ are significant at 1-percent level.)

dummy, a sex-of-respondent dummy, and four dummies corresponding to the
second, third, fourth, and fifth quintiles of the wealth distribution.
In columns (2), (5), and (8), the only modification is that we use 19, rather
than four wealth dummies, which means that we have now chopped up the
wealth distribution into 5-percent increments. This allows us to get a tighter
wealth control, but makes it impractical to display the individual coefficients on
all these dummies. Finally, in columns (3), (6), and (9), we add several further
controls: 19 income dummies; dummies for each year of age and education
(which go in place of the linear age and education terms and represent a more
conservative approach to controlling for these factors); state dummies; and the
Depressed and Low Tech variables.
As can be seen, the results paint a consistent picture. Consider first the Know
Neighbors measure of social interaction. The coefficients on this variable are
very close to 0.040 in all three regressions, implying that social households have
a 4 percent higher probability of participating in the stock market, all else being
equal. Moreover, in each case the coefficients are statistically significant at the
1-percent level. The Visit Neighbors variable looks to be a weaker version of
Know Neighbors, with coefficients that range between 0.022 and 0.025, but that
are still statistically significant. Finally, the Attend Church variable delivers
coefficients that are comparable to those on Know Neighbors in the first two
regressions—of the order of 0.036—but that tail off a bit, to a value of 0.027,
when the full set of controls is added.
The coefficients on some of the other controls are worth a brief mention. To begin with, we confirm earlier work by finding very powerful effects of education,
race, and wealth on stock-market participation. For example, our estimates
suggest that white, non-Hispanic households have about a 10 percent greater
participation rate than other groups, all else being equal. The Risk Tolerant
dummy has the expected positive sign, and with a value of around 0.037 across
most of the specifications, it appears to be economically as well as strongly statistically significant. The Depressed and Low Tech indicators are both negative,
as anticipated, and significantly so.
However, we caution against attaching the same kind of causal interpretation to the Low Tech proxy that one might naturally lend to, for example, the
Risk Tolerant variable. As discussed above, with Low Tech, we are in effect running one type of endogenous outcome (stock-market participation) on another
(computer use). The goal in this case is not to make a structural inference, but
rather to illustrate that, to the best of our ability to control for a personality
trait like open-mindedness, this control does not seem to affect the coefficients
on our key sociability indicators.
The results in Table III speak to the average effects of sociability across all demographic groups. In Table IV, we investigate how the marginal effect of social
interaction varies with race, education, and wealth. Based on our model, there
are two distinct reasons to expect that the coefficients on the social variables
would be higher among white, educated, and wealthy households.22 First, to the
22
Moreover, the simple two-way sorts in Panel B of Table I suggest that the effect of sociability
is much stronger among wealthier households.

Table IV

Interactions of Sociability with Wealth, Education, and Race
The sample comprises households in the Health and Retirement Study conducted in 1992. The
dependent variable is an indicator that the household owns stock. The independent variables are the
Sociability indicator (either Know Neighbors, Visit Neighbors, or Attend Church) and the Sociability
indicator interacted with the White, Educated, and Wealthy indicator. The White, Educated, and
Wealthy indicator equals one for households who are white/non-Hispanic, who have at least one
high-school graduate and who have wealth above the sample median. The regression specifications
also include all of the control variables used in column (2) of Table III (Risk Tolerant indicator, Years
of Education, Age, White and Non-Hispanic indicator, Urban indicator, dummies for every 5 percent
of the wealth distribution, marital status dummies, and a sex-of respondent dummy). There are
7,465 household observations. (Numbers with ∗ are significant at 10-percent level. Numbers with
∗∗ are significant at 5-percent level. Numbers with ∗∗∗ are significant at 1-percent level.)

extent that households interact with others having similar demographic characteristics, peer effects should be stronger among those groups with high participation rates. To take an extreme example, no amount of interaction is likely to
foster much information-sharing about the stock market if it takes place among
non-white/Hispanic households in the first quintile of the wealth distribution,
where the overall participation rate is only 1.2 percent (see Table I).
Second, even if social interaction did somehow lead to the same informational
(or other) benefit across all demographic groups, this benefit would be less likely
to cause a shift from non-participation to participation among those groups
for whom the gains from participation are so small relative to the non-socialrelated component of fixed cost that they tend to be well below the participation
threshold. For example, if we look at groups with very low wealth, we are on
average so far from the participation/non-participation cusp that any benefits
from social interaction do not have much impact on behavior. Note that in this
case, an exactly identical argument applies to other participation-enhancing
variables, such as risk tolerance: It is unlikely that increases in risk tolerance
will have much effect on stock-market participation among the lowest-wealth
groups.
Table IV confirms these predictions. In this table, everything is a variation on
the specifications in columns (2), (5), and (8) of Table III. That is, the regressions
include—in addition to the displayed terms involving the social variables—the
Risk Tolerant dummy, years of education, age, a white/non-Hispanic dummy,
an urban dummy, a marital-status dummy, a sex-of-respondent dummy, and 19
wealth dummies, all of which are suppressed for compactness. Each social variable now enters not only alone, but also interacted with the White, Educated,

Social Interaction and Stock-Market Participation

153

and Wealthy indicator, which takes on the value 1 for those households who
are white and non-Hispanic, who are at least high-school graduates and who
have wealth above the sample median. These households represent 39.1 percent of the total sample, and have an average participation rate of 49.1 percent,
as compared to the remaining households, who have an average participation
rate of only 12.3 percent.
The interaction terms are large in magnitude, and statistically significant in
two out of three cases. By summing the raw social coefficient with the interaction coefficient, one obtains an estimate of the size of the social effect among
white, educated, and wealthy households. For the Know Neighbors variable,
this number is 0.080, implying that social households in this demographic group
have an 8 percent greater participation rate than non-social households. For
the Visit Neighbors and Attend Church variables, the corresponding numbers
are 0.059 and 0.071, respectively. In each case, the effect of the social variable
among white, educated, and wealthy households appears to be roughly double
the size of the unconditional effect across all demographic groups reported in
Table III.
Beyond what is displayed in Tables III and IV, we have also experimented
with a number of variations on our baseline specifications, in order to further
check the robustness of our results. First, we have redone everything with
alternative definitions of stock-market participation that require a household
to have some minimal level invested in the market (we have tried thresholds of
$2,500, $5,000, $10,000, and $25,000) as opposed to just anything over zero, in
order to be counted as a participant.23 This is an effort to address the possibility
that small stakes in the market may ref lect activities like investment clubs,
which could be correlated with social interaction in a relatively mechanical and
uninteresting way. As it turns out, these alternative definitions of participation
lead to results that are very similar to those reported in Tables III and IV. Thus
these results do not appear to be driven by investors with only trivial stakes in
the market.
Second, we have also tried adding several further controls (beyond those
shown in columns (3), (6), and (9) of Table III) to our specifications. These
controls include: whether or not the household owns its home; whether the
household takes regular vacations; employment status; number of people in the
household (i.e., how many children there are at home); and various measures of
health. Several of these controls can be motivated as attempts to capture how
busy a household is dealing with other things, and hence how little free time it
has to devote to stock-market investing. For example, a household that has five
children, two parents with full-time jobs, and that never takes vacations may
simply be too overwhelmed either to interact with its neighbors, or to invest
in stocks. And we want to be sure that such a lack-of-free-time effect is not
inducing a spurious correlation between our sociability measures and stockmarket participation. However, we find that none of the additional controls
23
Among those households who participate in the market, the median amount invested is
$20,000. The 25th percentile of the distribution is $5,000, and the 75th percentile is $65,000.

154

has any noticeable impact on the coefficients associated with the sociability
measures.
B. Effect of Social Interaction in High-Participation
and Low-Participation States
While the results thus far are consistent with our theory, the worry remains
that our social variables are not picking up the effect of social interaction per se,
but rather an individual personality trait that is correlated with stock-market
participation and that is somehow not adequately captured by either our Risk
Tolerant, Depressed, or Low Tech proxies, or by any of the other controls we
have tried. In an effort to address this concern, we exploit the fact that our
theory has subsidiary implications that the alternative hypothesis does not.
In particular, if social households invest more because of their interactions
with other investors, then the marginal effect of sociability ought to be more
pronounced in areas where there is a high density of stock-market participants.
The best we can do to operationalize this idea is to look at the states in which
households live, since the HRS does not provide more detailed address data.
Table V presents some information on stock-market participation at the state
level. We group states into low, medium, and high participation categories,
where a state’s participation level is measured in one of two ways. In Panel A,
we look at the raw participation rate, which for any state is simply the fraction
of resident households that own stock. In Panel B, we look at the abnormal
participation rate, which for any state corresponds to the state-average-value
of the residual in a regression of household participation against: the Risk Tolerant dummy, years of education, age, a white/non-Hispanic dummy, an urban
dummy, a marital status dummy, a sex-of-respondent dummy, and four wealth
dummies.
As can be seen in Table V, many of the same states show up as outliers
according to either the raw or abnormal measure. Perhaps most strikingly, several largely rural southern states—Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee,
Mississippi, and West Virginia—are classified as having low participation rates
on either score. In the context of our model, a state’s abnormal participation
rate—given that we have taken out the effects of factors like wealth, risk tolerance, education, and race—is most naturally thought of as a measure of the
average value of the common participation-cost parameter for its residents. For
example, a state with a low abnormal participation rate may be one in which
there are relatively few stockbrokers per capita, so that residents have less help
getting started in the stock market.
This observation suggests another way to think of our empirical strategy, particularly insofar as we rely on abnormal, rather than raw participation rates.
When we look to see if the impact of social interaction is more pronounced in
a low-participation-cost (i.e., high-abnormal-participation) state, this is effectively a cross-state test of the social multiplier hypothesis. As discussed above,
the model suggests that as we move from a high-participation-cost environment
(Alabama) to a low-participation-cost environment (Connecticut), participation
among socials should increase by more than participation among non-socials.

Table VI presents the tests of this hypothesis. The structure is very similar
to that of Table IV, with all the same suppressed controls. Now, in addition to
having our social variables enter by themselves, we also interact them with an
indicator variable that takes on the values {–1, 0, 1} depending on whether a
state is classified as low, medium, or high participation.24 We try basing this

Given that our ability to estimate any state’s true mean participation costs is imperfect, we
do this grouping—rather than simply having each state’s own participation rate enter directly
in the regression—in an effort to combat measurement error and to improve the precision of our
estimates.

Interactions of Sociability and Risk Tolerance with State-level
Participation Rates
The sample comprises households in the Health and Retirement Study conducted in 1992. The dependent variable is an indicator that the household owns stock. The independent variables are the
Sociability indicator (either Know Neighbors, Visit Neighbors, or Attend Church) and the Sociability indicator interacted with the State-level Participation indicator. The State-level Participation
indicator takes on the values −1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the household’s state has low,
medium, or high stock-market participation. In columns (1), (3), and (5), state-level participation
is measured on a raw basis; in columns (2), (4), and (6), it is measured on an abnormal basis. The
other independent variables shown in the table are the Risk Tolerant indicator and its interaction with the State-Level Participation indicator. The regression specifications also include Years
of Education, Age, a White and Non-Hispanic indicator, an Urban indicator, dummies for every
5 percent of the wealth distribution, a sex-of-respondent dummy, marital status dummies, and the
State-Level Participation indicator. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. There are 7,465
household observations. (Numbers with ∗ are significant at 10-percent level. Numbers with ∗∗ are
significant at 5-percent level. Numbers with ∗∗∗ are significant at 1-percent level.)

indicator both on the raw participation measure, as well as on our preferred
abnormal participation measure.
The results are generally encouraging. When we use the abnormal participation measure, the coefficient on the interaction of sociability and state-level
participation is positive in all three cases, and strongly statistically significant in both the Know Neighbors and Attend Church regressions. In terms of
economic magnitudes, the Know Neighbors regression suggests that the differential between social and non-social households is actually a tiny bit negative,
at −0.5 percent, in a low-abnormal-participation state, but rises to 9 percent
in a high-participation state. With Attend Church, the corresponding numbers
are 0.3 percent and 6.5 percent. Clearly, these are economically significant
differences.
When we use the raw participation measure, the interaction coefficient in the
Know Neighbors regression is unchanged, but that for Attend Church drops off
substantially, and is no longer significant. The regressions with our weakest social variable, Visit Neighbors, do not show a statistically significant interaction

Social Interaction and Stock-Market Participation

coefficient in either the raw or abnormal-participation specification, though in
both cases these coefficients have the predicted positive sign.
To further bolster the case that these results are really telling us something
about social effects, in all the regressions in Table VI we also interact our Risk
Tolerant variable with the same state-level participation indicators—that is,
we treat Risk Tolerant in a way that is symmetric to our social measures.
The premise here is as follows. We are reasonably confident that the Risk
Tolerant variable is capturing information about a personality trait that is relevant for participation but that has nothing to do with social effects. Thus Risk
Tolerant should have the same coefficient regardless of what state a household lives in. In other words, Risk Tolerant should not show the same interaction with the state-level participation indicators that our social measures
do.
And indeed, Table VI confirms this hypothesis. While the Risk Tolerant variable continues to attract a highly significant positive coefficient when standing
alone, the interaction terms involving Risk Tolerant are small and completely
insignificant in all six specifications. Thus Risk Tolerant behaves in a fundamentally different way across states than do our social variables. Again, this
lends further weight to the notion that these social variables are not just another personality trait in disguise.
It is worth contrasting our approach to using cross-state variation in Table VI
to other approaches that are common in the peer-effects literature (see, e.g.,
Glaeser and Scheinkman (2000) for a discussion). In particular, by analogy
to some of this other work, we can use our data to demonstrate the following.
First, if one adds the mean participation rate in a household’s home state to the
baseline regression in column (1) of Table III, it comes in strongly significant,
with a coefficient of 0.240 and a t-statistic of 3.48. Thus controlling for its own
characteristics, a household is substantially more likely to participate in the
market if it lives in a high-participation state. Alternatively, one can add the
mean education and wealth levels in a state to the same baseline regression,
with the same qualitative result—a household is significantly more likely to
participate in the market if it lives in a state with a wealthier and more educated
population.
These sorts of results are certainly consistent with the existence of social
effects, and are probably the best that one could do without access to the direct measures of sociability that the HRS affords us. But since they do not
exploit the interaction of sociability and cross-state variation in participation,
they are more subject to alternative interpretations. For example, suppose
that brokerage firms endogenously choose to have more branch offices
in wealthy states, and that such branch offices facilitate participation. If so,
this could explain why either a state’s wealth, or its mean participation rate,
matters for individual-household participation, even absent any social effects.
By contrast, our Table VI results cannot be explained away in this fashion,
so long as one is willing to adopt the identifying assumption that the effect
of branch offices on participation is the same for social and non-social
households.

C. A Look at the 1998 War-Baby Survey
As noted above, in addition to the original 1992 HRS survey, we have a second independent sample of households—those in the war-baby cohort that were
surveyed in 1998. Unfortunately, this sample is much smaller—roughly 1,400
as opposed to 7,500 observations—and it does not include the survey questions
that allow us to construct either the Know Neighbors or Attend Church variables. The only social variable that remains is the Visit Neighbors variable,
which we have found thus far to yield the weakest results of the three.25 Also,
this version of the survey does not enable us to construct the Risk Tolerant
control.
Nevertheless, working with the limited data we do have, we undertake in
Table VII a comparison of the two different samples. We run the exact same
regression for each, the specification being the same as that in column (4) of
Table III, except with the Risk Tolerant control dropped. In principle, there
are two things that could potentially be accomplished with such a comparison.
First, the 1998 data enable us to perform an obvious out-of-sample robustness
check on the results from the 1992 survey.
Second, and more ambitiously, one might hope to test the intertemporal
social-multiplier aspect of our theory. Mirroring the overall rise in stock-market
participation over the 1990s, the average participation rate among the war babies in 1998 is 32.3 percent; this represents a 21 percent increase from the 26.7
percent participation rate among the original 1992 HRS cohort.26 If one thinks
of this time trend in participation as ref lecting an economy-wide decrease in
costs of participation, then our model suggests that participation should have
increased more among socials than among non-socials. Or said differently, the
existence of a social multiplier implies that the 1998 sample should yield a
larger coefficient on the social variable than the 1992 sample. Note that this
is essentially just an intertemporal version of the cross-state comparison made
in Table VI: In either case the prediction is that there should be a smaller coefficient on the social variable in a high-participation-cost regime (Alabama, or
the early 1990s) than in a low-participation-cost regime (Connecticut, or the
late 1990s).
The point estimates in Table VII suggest that our intertemporal socialmultiplier hypothesis is on target, but there is not enough power to state this
conclusion with any degree of statistical confidence. In particular, the coefficient on Visit Neighbors goes from 0.020 in the 1992 sample to 0.035 in the
1998 sample, a striking increase of 75 percent. Unfortunately, with the much
smaller sample, the 1998 coefficient is too imprecisely estimated to allow us to
25

Of households, 67.8 percent visit their neighbors in the 1998 sample, very close to the 1992
sample value of 63.9 percent, suggesting that this variable is picking up similar information in both
surveys. Looking over a much broader span of time, Putnam (1995) argues that social interaction
among Americans has declined, but this trend does not show up with our simplistic measure over
the relatively short 1992 to 1998 interval.
26
Moreover, as pointed out above, the war babies are almost exactly the same age in 1998 as the
original HRS respondents were in 1992, so this seems to be a clean comparison.

D. Social Interaction and Checking Account Use
An interesting recent paper by Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2000) finds
that in those regions of Italy where “social capital” is high, people make more
use of a variety of financial products, including stock-market investments and
checking accounts. Following the work of Putnam (1993), Guiso et al. (2000)
argue that social capital—which they measure at the regional level using electoral participation and per-capita blood donations—helps to increase the trust
that people have in a variety of institutions, including financial institutions.
While the social-capital variables used by Guiso et al. (2000) are obviously
quite different from our social-interaction proxies, one might stretch and argue
that our results ref lect a similar kind of social-capital mechanism. Perhaps
those households that interact with their neighbors or that attend church have
more trust in financial institutions generally, and hence are less fearful that

they will be ripped off when they put their money somewhere other than under
their mattress.
Although it is hard for us to address this hypothesis fully with our data, we
can take a small step by looking at the effect of our social-interaction variables
on checking account use. If our variables really are a proxy for a generalized
trust in financial institutions, then one might expect them to explain checking
account use as well as stock-market participation, much as the social-capital
variables of Guiso et al. (2000) do in the Italian data.
In Table VIII, we run exactly the same specifications as in columns (2), (5),
and (8) of Table III, except that we replace the stock-market participation indicator on the left-hand side of the regression with a checking account use
indicator. (Overall, 78.2 percent of the households in our sample have checking
accounts.) As can be seen, our social variables do essentially nothing to explain
checking account use. The estimated coefficients are all very small—actually
negative in two out of three cases—and never close to statistically significant.
Although this is admittedly just a small bit of evidence, it would seem to cut
against the hypothesis that these social variables are indicative of a general
trust in financial institutions.
Two other interesting results appear in Table VIII. First of all, the Risk
Tolerant dummy attracts a strongly negative and significant coefficient,

Social Interaction and Stock-Market Participation

suggesting that risk-averse households are, not implausibly, more likely to have
checking accounts. And the coefficient on the race indicator implies that nonwhite/Hispanic households are almost 14 percent less likely to have checking
accounts, all else equal. This is an enormous effect, and it suggests that even
though our social variables may not capture trust, there may be substantially
less trust of financial institutions among members of some minority groups.
IV. Conclusions
Three significant findings emerge from our analysis of the HRS data. First,
social households—those that interact with their neighbors, or that attend
church—are more likely to invest in the stock market than non-social households, all else equal. Second, the impact of sociability is much stronger in those
states where stock-market participation rates are higher. Third, and by far most
tentatively, the differential between social and non-social households appears
to have widened over the course of the 1990s, as overall participation rates have
climbed sharply.
This evidence is broadly consistent with the hypothesis that social interaction helps to increase stock-market participation. At the same time, we have
been somewhat vague as to the exact mechanism by which social interaction
promotes participation. We have discussed two possible stories—one having to
do with word-of-mouth information-sharing, the other with the enjoyment that
people get from talking about the market together—but have made no effort to
discriminate between them. And it should be noted that this distinction might
be a significant one, particularly with regard to the more dynamic aspects of
the theory.
To see why, suppose that the stock market performs poorly over the next several years, leading some investors to get discouraged and withdraw. To what extent do these departing investors create an externality that affects their peers
who are already in the market?27 Under at least some versions of the wordof-mouth information-sharing story, the externality might be expected to be
unimportant, since the presumption is that those who are already in the market know whatever it is they need to know about how to invest. However, under
the enjoyment-from-talking-about-the-market story, there is an obvious externality, with any individual’s decision to leave the market making it more likely
that others in his peer group will leave too. One objective for future work might
be to try to distinguish between these two possibilities.
In closing, a final point to highlight is the potentially close connection between the ideas presented here and the growing empirical literature on “local preference” in the stock market. A series of papers has demonstrated that
investors strongly tilt their portfolios not only towards home-country stocks
(French and Poterba (1991), Cooper and Kaplanis (1994), Tesar and Werner
(1995), Kang and Stulz (1997)), but also towards the stocks of firms that are
27
In any version of our model, there is a clear prediction that departing investors exert a negative
inf luence on the participation decisions of those who have not yet begun to invest in the market.

headquartered nearby, or that are otherwise more familiar (Huberman (2001),
Coval and Moskowitz (1999), Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000)). In many of these
papers, the explicit or implicit story being told is that it is easier for investors
to learn about nearby stocks. In other words, in the language of our model,
participation costs are lower for nearby stocks.
If one accepts this interpretation, then our model suggests that socialinteraction effects may help to amplify whatever aggregate local preference is
induced by exogenous cross-stock differences in participation costs. Thus even
if the direct, observable costs to a U.S. investor of buying, say, Japanese stocks
are only modestly greater than the costs incurred with U.S. stocks, the social
equilibrium may involve a very pronounced home-country bias. In such an equilibrium, many U.S. investors may be deterred from investing in Japan largely
because they do not know anybody else who does. This hypothesis would seem
to provide another natural direction for future research.
