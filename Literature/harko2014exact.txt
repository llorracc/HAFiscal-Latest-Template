In this paper, the exact analytical solution of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
epidemic model is obtained in a parametric form. By using the exact solution we investigate
some explicit models corresponding to ﬁxed values of the parameters, and show that
the numerical solution reproduces exactly the analytical solution. We also show that the
generalization of the SIR model, including births and deaths, described by a nonlinear
system of differential equations, can be reduced to an Abel type equation. The reduction
of the complex SIR model with vital dynamics to an Abel type equation can greatly simplify
the analysis of its properties. The general solution of the Abel equation is obtained by using a
perturbative approach, in a power series form, and it is shown that the general solution of
the SIR model with vital dynamics can be represented in an exact parametric form.

1. Introduction
The outbreak and spread of diseases has been questioned and studied for many years. In fact, Graunt was the ﬁrst scientist
who attempted to quantify causes of death systematically [1], and his analysis of causes of death ended up with a theory that
is now well established among modern epidemiologists. Bernoulli was the ﬁrst mathematician to propose a mathematical
model describing an infectious disease. In 1760 he modeled the spread of smallpox [2], which was prevalent at the time,
and argued the advantages of variolation [3]. A simple deterministic (compartmental) model predicting the behavior of
epidemic outbreaks was formulated by McKendrick and Kermack in 1927 [4]. In their mathematical epidemic model, called
the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, or the xyz model, to describe the spread of diseases, McKendrick and
Kermack proposed the following nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations [4]

respectively, with the initial conditions xð0Þ ¼ N 1 P 0; yð0Þ ¼ N 2 P 0 and zð0Þ ¼ N 3 P 0; N i 2 R; i ¼ 1; 2; 3, and where the
infection rate b and the mean recovery rate c are positive constants. In this model a ﬁxed population with only three compartments is considered: susceptible (S) xðtÞ, infected (I) yðtÞ, and recovered (R) zðtÞ, respectively. The compartments used for
this model consist of three classes:
(a) the function xðtÞ represents the number of individuals not yet infected with disease at time t or those susceptible to
the disease,
(b) the function yðtÞ represents the number of individuals who have been infected with the disease, and are capable of
spreading the disease to those in the susceptible category, and
(c) the function zðtÞ is the compartment of the individuals who have been infected and then recovered from the disease. Those in this category are not able to be infected again, or to transmit the infection to others. For this model
the initial conditions xð0Þ ¼ N 1 ; yð0Þ ¼ N 2 and zð0Þ ¼ N 3 are not independent, since they must satisfy the condition
N 1 þ N 2 þ N 3 ¼ N, where N is the total ﬁxed number of the individuals in the given population. The constants b and
c give the transition rates between compartments. The transition rate between S (Susceptible) and I (infected) is b,
where b is the contact rate, which takes into account the probability of getting the disease in a contact between a
susceptible and an infectious subject [5–8]. The transition rate between I (Infected) and R (recovered), is c, which
has the meaning of the rate of recovery or death. If the duration of the infection is denoted D, then c ¼ 1=D, since
an individual experiences one recovery in D units of time [5–8]. Since b and c are interpreted as transition rates
(probabilities), their range is 0 6 b 6 1 and 0 6 c 6 1, respectively.
In many infectious diseases, such as in the case of measles, there is an arrival of new susceptible individuals into the
population. For this type of situation deaths must be included in the model. By considering a population characterized by
a death rate l and a birth rate equal to the death rate, the non-linear system of the differential equations representing this
epidemic model is given by [5–8],

and it must be considered with the initial conditions xð0Þ ¼ N 1 ; yð0Þ ¼ N 2 and zð0Þ ¼ N 3 , with the constants N i ; i ¼ 1; 2; 3
P
satisfying the condition 3i¼1 N i ¼ N.
The non-linear differential equations systems, given by Eqs. (1)–(3) and (4)–(6) represent modiﬁed three-dimensional
competitive Lotka–Volterra type models [5,7]. These systems can also be related to the so-called T systems, introduced
recently in [9], and which have the form

ð9Þ

which is chaotic for a0 ¼ 2:1; b0 ¼ 0:6 and c0 ¼ 30. The mathematical properties of the T-system were studied in [10–12].
In recent years, the mathematical epidemic models given by Eqs. (1)–(3) and (4)–(6) were investigated numerically in a
number of papers, with the use of a wide variety of methods and techniques, namely, the Adomian decomposition method
[13], the variational iteration method [14], the homotopy perturbation method [15], and the differential transformation
method [16], respectively. Very recently, a stochastic epidemic-type model with enhanced connectivity was analyzed
in [17], and an exact solution of the model was obtained. With the use of a quantum mechanical approach the master equation
was transformed via a quantum spin operator formulation. The time-dependent density of infected, recovered and susceptible
populations for random initial conditions was calculated exactly. An exact solution of a particular case of the SIR and
Susceptible–Infected–Susceptible (SIS) epidemic models was presented in [18]. Note that in the latter SIS model, the infected
return to the susceptible class on recovery because the disease confers no immunity against reinfection. A SIR epidemic model

186

with nonlinear incidence rate and time delay was investigated in [19], while an age-structured SIR epidemic model with
time periodic coefﬁcients was studied in [20]. In fact, the standard pair approximation equations for the SusceptibleInfective-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) model of infection spread on a network of homogeneous degree k predict a thin phase
of sustained oscillations for parameter values that correspond to diseases that confer long lasting immunity. Indeed, the latter
SIRS model has been thoroughly studied, with the results strongly suggesting that its stochastic Markovian version does not
yield sustained oscillations [21]. A stochastic model of infection dynamics based on the Susceptible-Infective-Recovered
model, where the distribution of the recovery times can be tuned, interpolating between exponentially distributed recovery
times, as in the standard SIR model, and recovery after a ﬁxed infectious period, was investigated in [22]. For large
populations, the spectrum of ﬂuctuations around the deterministic limit of the model was obtained analytically.
An epidemic model with stage structure was introduced in [23], with the period of infection partitioned into the early and
later stages according to the developing process of infection. The basic reproduction number of this model is determined by
the method of next generation matrix. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the local stability of the
endemic equilibrium have been obtained, with the global stability of the endemic equilibrium is determined under the
condition that the infection is not fatal. Lyapunov functions for classical SIR and SIS epidemiological models were introduced
in [24], and the global stability of the endemic equilibrium states of the models were thereby established. A new Lyapunov
function for a variety of SIR and SIRS models in epidemiology was introduced in [25]. Traveling wave trains in generalized
two-species predator–prey models and two-component reaction–diffusion equations were considered in [26], and the
stability of the ﬁxed points of the traveling wave ordinary differential equations in the usual ‘‘spatial’’ variable was analyzed.
For general functional forms of the nonlinear prey birthrate/prey death rate or reaction terms, a Hopf bifurcation occurs at
two different critical values of the traveling wave speed. Subcritical Hopf bifurcations yield more complex post-bifurcation
dynamics in the wavetrains of the system of the partial differential equations. In order to investigate the post-bifurcation
dynamics all the models were integrated numerically, and chaotic regimes were characterized by computing power spectra,
autocorrelation functions, and fractal dimensions, respectively.
It is the purpose of this paper to present the exact analytical solution of the SIR epidemic model. The solution is obtained
in an exact parametric form. The generalization of the SIR model including births deaths, described by Eqs. (4)–(6), is also
considered, and we show that the nonlinear system of differential equations governing the generalized SIR model can be
reduced to an Abel type equation. The general solution of the Abel equations is obtained by using an iterative method
and, once the solution of this ordinary differential equation is known, the general solution of the SIR model with vital
dynamics can be obtained, similarly to the standard SIR model, in an exact parametric form.
The present paper is organized as follows. The exact solution of the SIR epidemic model is presented in Section 2. The
nonlinear system of differential equations governing the SIR model with deaths is reduced to an Abel type equation, and
the general solution of the model equations is obtained in an exact parametric form in Section 3. We conclude our results
in Section 4.
2. The exact solution of the SIR epidemic model
By adding Eqs. (1)–(3), yields the following differential equation,

d
½xðtÞ þ yðtÞ þ zðtÞ ¼ 0;

ð10Þ

which can be immediately integrated to give

xðtÞ þ yðtÞ þ zðtÞ ¼ N;

8t P 0;

ð11Þ

where xðtÞ > 0; yðtÞ > 0 and zðtÞ > 0; 8t P 0. Hence, the total population N ¼ N 1 þ N 2 þ N 3 must be an arbitrary positive
integration constant. This is consistent with the model in which only a ﬁxed population N with only three compartments
is considered.
2.1. The general evolution equation for the SIR model

ð26Þ

where t 0 is an arbitrary integration constant, and one may choose t 0 ¼ 0, without loss of generality. Hence we have obtained
the complete exact solution of the system of Eqs. (1)–(3), describing the SIR epidemic model, given in a parametric form by

ð30Þ

Comparing Eq. (30) with Eq. (11), we have

C 1 ¼ bN

ð31Þ

and hence C 1 is a negative integration constant. Eqs. (26)–(31) give the exact parametric solution of the SIR system of three
differential equations, with u taken as parameter. The solution describes exactly the dynamical evolution of the SIR system
for any given initial conditions xð0Þ ¼ N 1 ; yð0Þ ¼ N 2 and zð0Þ ¼ N 3 , and for arbitrary values of b and c. The numerical values
of the two constants in the solution, u0 and C 1 are determined by the model parameters and the initial conditions. Any
change in the numerical values of the initial conditions and/or of the rate parameters will not affect the validity of the
solution.
In order to compare the results of the present analytical solution with the results of the numerical integration of the system of differential equations Eqs. (1)–(3) we adopt the initial values and the numerical values for the coefﬁcients considered
in [16]. Hence we take N 1 ¼ 20, N 2 ¼ 15, and N 3 ¼ 10, respectively. For the parameter b we take the value b ¼ 0:01, while
c ¼ 0:02. The variations of xðtÞ, yðtÞ and zðtÞ obtained by both numerical integration and the use of the analytical solution
are represented, as a function of time, in Fig. 1.
As one can see from the ﬁgure, the analytical solution perfectly reproduces the results of the numerical integration. The
exact solution we found here is also in complete agreement with the numerical results obtained in [13–16]. The variation of
zðtÞ for different initial conditions xð0Þ; yð0Þ and zð0Þ is represented in Fig. 2.
In the present Section, after a brief discussion of the general properties of the SIR model with births and deaths, we will
show that the time evolution of the SIR model with equal birth and death rates can be obtained from the study of a single
ﬁrst order Abel type differential equation. An iterative approach for solving this equation is also presented.
3. The SIR model with equal death and birth rates
In the present Section we consider the extension of the simple SIR model given by Eqs. (1)–(3) by including equal rates of
births and deaths. In this case the system of differential equations we are going to consider is given by Eqs. (4)–(6).
It is easy to see that by adding Eqs. (4)–(6), and integrating the resulting equation yields the following result

xðtÞ þ yðtÞ þ zðtÞ ¼ N þ N0 elt

ð32Þ

for this model, where N 0 is an arbitrary integration constant. In order that to total number of individuals is a constant,

respectively. The numerical and the analytical solutions completely overlap.

we must ﬁx the arbitrary integration constant N 0 as zero, N 0 ¼ 0.
The variation of xðtÞ; yðtÞ and zðtÞ for the SIR model with vital dynamics is represented in Fig. 3.
3.1. Qualitative properties of the SIR model with vital dynamics
Both the simple SIR model (l ¼ 0) and the SIR model with vital dynamics (l – 0) are two dimensional dynamical systems
in the x þ y þ z ¼ N invariant plane. There is no chaotic behavior in the plane – essentially because the existence and unicity
theorem prevents (in dimension 2) the existence of transversal homoclinic points. The dynamics of both systems is simple,
and well understood, including the bifurcation that takes place at bN ¼ c þ l. There is also no chaotic behavior for l – 0 outside the x þ y þ z ¼ N invariant plane, because, as one can see from Eqs. (4)–(6), for the time evolution of x þ y þ z, trajectories with initial conditions out of the invariant plane tend exponentially fast to the invariant plane – there can be no attractor
or invariant set, chaotic or otherwise, outside the invariant plane. For l ¼ 0; y ¼ 0 is a line of degenerate equilibria, for all
parameter values.
For l – 0 and b < 0; x ¼ N; y ¼ 0; z ¼ 0 is a global attractor – a stable node –, while for b > 0,

this equilibrium point. We will prove this result by using the Lyapounov direct method. As a ﬁrst step we scale the variables
by population size, so that x ! x=N, and y ! y=N, respectively. Next we introduce the function Lðx; yÞ deﬁned as [8]

Lðx; yÞ ¼ x  x ln x þ y  y ln y;

3.2. The evolution equation of the SIR models with vital dynamics
We derive now the basic differential equation describing the dynamics of the SIR model with equal birth and death rates.
We differentiate Eq. (6) with respect to the time t and obtain ﬁrst the second order differential equation

Eqs. (70), (72), (74) and (78) give the general solution of the SIR model with vital dynamics, in a parametric form, with w
taken as a parameter.
In Fig. 4 we present the comparison of the exact numerical solution for yðtÞ with the different order approximations
obtained by iteratively solving the Abel equation (61). After twenty steps the iterative and the numerical solution
approximately overlap.
4. Conclusions
In the present paper we have considered two versions of the SIR model, describing the spread of an epidemic in a given
population. For the SIR model without births and deaths the exact analytical solution was obtained in a parametric form. The
main properties of the exact solution were investigated numerically, and it was shown that it reproduces exactly the
numerical solution of the model equations.
For the SIR model with births and deaths we have shown that the non-linear system of differential equations governing it
can be reduced to the Abel equation (57). This Abel equation can be easily studied by means of semi-analytical/numerical
methods, thus leading to a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation in the study of the model. Once the general solution of the Abel equation
is known, the general solution of the SIR epidemic model with deaths can be obtained in an exact parametric form.

The exact solution is important because biologists could use it to run experiments to observe the spread of infectious diseases by introducing natural initial conditions. Through these experiments one can learn the ways on how to control the
spread of epidemics.
