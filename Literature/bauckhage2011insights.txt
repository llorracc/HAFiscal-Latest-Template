Abstract
Internet memes are phenomena that rapidly gain popularity
or notoriety on the Internet. Often, modiﬁcations or spoofs
add to the proﬁle of the original idea thus turning it into a
phenomenon that transgresses social and cultural boundaries.
It is commonly assumed that Internet memes spread virally
but scientiﬁc evidence as to this assumption is scarce. In this
paper, we address this issue and investigate the epidemic dynamics of 150 famous Internet memes. Our analysis is based
on time series data that were collected from Google Insights,
Delicious, Digg, and StumbleUpon. We ﬁnd that differential equation models from mathematical epidemiology as well
as simple log-normal distributions give a good account of
the growth and decline of memes. We discuss the role of
log-normal distributions in modeling Internet phenomena and
touch on practical implications of our ﬁndings.

reﬂecting the rise and decline in popularity of this Internet meme

Introduction
Figure 1: Example of an Internet meme. On April 22, 2007,
singer Tay Zonday (upper left) posted a home-made music
video on YouTube. The catchy tune and somewhat awkward
performance apparently appealed to a large audience: as
of this writing, the “chocolate rain” video has been viewed
more than 57,000,000 times and was frequently spoofed and
re-contextualized.

The term Internet meme refers to the phenomenon of content
or concepts that spread rapidly among Internet users. It alludes to a theory by Dawkin (1976) who postulates memes as
a cultural analogon of genes in order to explain how rumors,
catch-phrases, melodies, or fashion trends replicate through
a population. Whether or not memes do really exist is heatedly debated and we do not intend to join that discourse.
Instead, our discussion in this paper focuses on observable
characteristics of Internet memes that resemble those of viral spread and epidemic outbreaks.
In their basic form, Internet memes propagate among people by means of email, instant messaging, forums, blogs, or
social networking sites. Content-wise, they usually consist
of offbeat news, websites, catch phrases, images, or video
clips (see Figs. 1 and 2). Put in simple terms, Internet memes
are inside jokes or pieces of hip underground knowledge,
that many people are in on.
Internet memes typically evolve through commentary, imitations, or parodies, or even through related news in other
media. Most Internet memes spread rapidly; some were observed to go in and out of popularity in just a matter of days.
Memes are spread in a voluntary, peer to peer fashion, rather
than in a compulsory manner. Their proliferation through

social communities does not follow predetermined paths and
usually deﬁes efforts to control it.
As of late, the phenomenon of Internet memes has itself
attracted growing public interest. Popular web sites such
as knowyourmeme.com, memedump.com, or memebase.com
view them as a form of art and provide accounts of the origin
and evolution of famous memes.
Professionals in public relations and advertising, too, have
embraced Internet memes. In viral marketing, there are examples of memes that were purposely designed to create
publicity for products or services. Finally, political campaigning increasingly attempts to create Internet memes to
shape opinion. They are supposed to create an image of
trendiness but often interest in the content is for purposes
of trivia or frivolity rather than for information.
Given the public interest in Internet memes, it is sobering
to see that many aspects of the phenomenon are still poorly

interplay between social and traditional media (Leskovec,
Backstrom, and Kleinberg 2009). Although these contributions touch on outbreak analysis and peak intensity modeling, they are not particularly concerned with time series
analysis and do not develop tools for forecasting the future
development of a rampant meme.
Outbreak analysis for trend prediction, however, is an active area of research in epidemic modeling (Britton 2010).
Moreover, similarities in the spread of diseases and rumors
have been noted for long (Dietz 1967) and are thought to
be an emergent property of the scale-free nature of socialor communication networks (Keeling and Eames 2005;
Lloyd and May 2001; Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani 2001).
This has led to several applications of traditional epidemic
modeling in the context of web technologies. Examples include mechanisms to curtail the activity of computer viruses
(Bloem, Alpcan, and Basar 2009) or attempts to infer social relations from observations of information propagation
among individuals (Myers and Leskovec 2010).
Work more closely related to what is reported here is due
to Yang and Lescovec (2011) and Kubo et al. (2007). The
former cluster time series obtained from a micro blogging
service in order to predict future interest in a topic. The
latter investigate the temporal evolution of content in bulletin boards and report that a simple stochastic compartment model gives a good account of the process. Concerned
with Internet memes, we could not corroborate these ﬁndings. While the time series analyzed by Kubo et al. quickly
tail off, temporal distributions that characterize meme popularity are, in their vast majority, heavily skewed and longtailed. Our results reported below indicate that more elaborate compartment models and log-normal distributions capture this behavior more accurately. Log-normal distributions are known to accurately model a wide range of longtail phenomena (Limpert, Stahel, and Abbt 2001) including Internet measurements such as communication times or
the growth of the web graph (Downey 2005; Mitzenmacher
2004). They were also found to characterize frequency
distributions of bookmarks or recommendations in bookmarking or recommender services (Wu and Huberman 2007;
Lescovec, Adamic, and Huberman 2007) as well as to represent the response dynamics of social systems to sudden
exogenous events (Crane and Sornette 2008).
Stochastic compartment models and log-normal distributions will be discussed again in more detail in a later section.

understood. Knowledge as to the dynamics of meme spread
is still more qualitative than quantitative and conclusions appear to be drawn from episodic rather than from analytic
evidence. As a consequence, models that would allow for
assessing the success of a viral campaign in its early stages
or for predicting the longevity or peak circulation of a rising
meme remain elusive to this date.
At the same time, scientiﬁc interest in the topic is noticeably increasing as more and more researchers in web data
mining and social network analysis are beginning to study
Internet memes. With the work reported here, we want to
contribute to these efforts. In particular, we are interested in
the temporal dynamics of Internet memes and study models
for predicting the evolution of their popularity. Our analysis is based on time series that were collected from Google
Insights as well as from three social bookmarking services,
namely delicious.com, digg.com, and stumbleupon.com.
We report on characteristic similarities and differences
among the data from the different sources. Our analysis reveals that the user communities of the considered services
appear to have different interests and show behaviors that
reﬂect different aspects of Internet memes.
Moreover, we study the use of models from mathematical
epidemiology and log-normal distributions in modeling the
temporal dynamics of Internet memes. We observe that both
provide accurate accounts for our data and we discuss our
ﬁndings with respect to the link structure of social graphs
centered around Internet memes. Finally, we apply our models in an attempt to predict the future evolution of various
Internet phenomena.
Our presentation proceeds as follows: next, we review related work and discuss it with respect to the approaches followed in this paper. Then, we introduce the time series data
that forms the empirical basis for our study. We analyze
similarities and differences among the data from different
sources and then introduce mathematical models of outbreak
data and apply them to characterize Internet memes and their
evolution. We conclude by summarizing our results.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of a collection
of 150 Internet memes. Table 1 lists a subset of 120 of these
memes; the remaining 30 examples are part of our analysis
but we avoid mentioning them because they are memes that

Related Work
Work related to Internet memes and their dynamics is found
in the areas of web intelligence and social network analysis. Several authors attempt to identify inﬂuential members in a community so as to contain the spread of misinformation or rumors (Budak, Agrawal, and Abbadi 2010;
Shah and Zaman 2009). Others propose models of how
events disseminate through online communities and use
these to track memes through speciﬁc social media (Adar
and Adamic 2005; Lin et al. 2010) or to investigate the

centered around acts of violence or torture (of animals) as
well as so called screamer memes that are intended to invoke a state of horror or nervous shock in their audience)

different Internet memes developed over time. From these examples, it seems that the later a meme occurred on the Internet,
the higher the degree of correlation of the corresponding time series.
• are of political nature (e.g. activist memes that promote
political ideas or malign political opponents)

The collected data were converted into a format representing average monthly activities for the period from January
2004 to December 2010. This resulted in discrete time series z = [z1 , z2 , . . . , zT ] covering a period T = 84 months
where z1 represents activities related to a meme in the month
of January 2004 and zT represents the corresponding activities for December 2010.
In order to compare meme related activities across different sources, the data wereturned into discrete probability
vectors x where xt = zt / i zi . Examples of the resulting
normalized time series are shown in Fig. 3
Onset times were determined using the discrete TeagerKaiser operator
(1)
T K(xt ) = x2t − xt−1 xt+1
which is a signal processing technique to detect abrupt variations in a data stream. For each of our time series, the earliest
such variation was said to deﬁne the onset time to . Model ﬁtting in later stages of our analysis was done using truncated
time series x = [xto , . . . , xT ].

• are related to personal or commercial web sites.
For each meme, we gathered data from Google Insights
that characterize how its popularity or notoriety developed
over time.
Google Insights is a service by Google that provides
statistics on queries terms users have entered into the Google
search engine. It provides weekly summaries of how frequently a query has been used in the time since January 1st
2004 and allows for narrowing down to regions and categories. For our study, we retrieved overall worldwide statistics. Note that Google Insights does not reveal absolute
search counts. Rather, the data is normalized such that the
peak search activity for a query is scaled to a value of 100.
Data obtained from Google Insights therefore indicates relative search frequencies and does not allow for estimating
absolute public interest in a topic.
When available, we also collected time series from Delicious, Digg, and StumbleUpon.
Delicious is a social bookmarking service for storing web
bookmarks. It has a search facility that summarizes when
and how many bookmarks were tagged with a query term.
The data is returned in form of summaries covering up to
three months but can be easily converted into average daily
activity counts. Unlike Google Insights, Delicious thus allows for estimating absolute user activities related to a topic.
Digg is a social news service where users can vote on web
content submitted by others. It provides a search API that
returns topic related activities of the community. Information is available on a per day basis but, compared to Google
Insights or Delicious, there is considerably less usage data.
StumbleUpon is a discovery engine that recommends
web content that has been entered by its users. We used
the available API to determine at which points in time users
commented on content related to our 150 memes. Again, the
data is available on a per day basis but is much sparser than
in the case of Google Insights or Delicious.

Immediate Observations and Implications
Looking at the time series in Fig. 3, it seems that over the
years there is a growing correlation between the frequencies
of meme related queries to Google and activities of the Delicious community. While Internet memes that appeared more
than ﬁve years ago show different temporal patterns for the
two sources, the corresponding time series of memes with
onset times later than 2006 seem more closely correlated.
In an attempt to quantify this observation, we examined
weighted average annual correlations between series from
Google Insights and their counterparts from the other services. For each year y ∈ {2004, . . . , 2010}, we considered
wy 
corr(x, x )

where Ny = |{(x, x ) | to (x) ∈ y}| and x is a Google time
series whose onset time to falls into year y and x denotes
the corresponding data from either of the other services.

The weights w2004 = 7/7, . . . , w2010 = 1/7 are chosen to penalize larger correlations due to shorter sequence
lengths. Figure 4 indicates that, on average, the largest correlations are between the Google and the Delicious time series. For all three services, we observe peak correlations in
the years from 2005 to 2007; the rather small values for 2010
suggest that the seemingly increasing correlations in Fig. 3
are indeed an artifact of shorter observation times.
Using the data that allow for the assessment of absolute
meme related activities, we compared interests and behaviors of different communities and determined the average
daily activities since onset time ranked in descending order.
Figure 5 shows the twenty highest ranking memes according to their per day popularity in the Delicious, Digg, and
StumbleUpon communities. Given the onset times in Tab. 1,
we note that, in the case of Digg, all of the top ranking Internet memes emerged during the last two years. This reﬂects
Digg’s role as a social news service: if content or stories that
just showed up on the Internet are posted at Digg, users react quickly to the news. Therefore, the shorter the time since
onset, the more meme related daily activity there is. On the
other hand, memes that have been around for a while hardly
provoke further reactions from the Digg community.
We also observe that about a quarter of the memes that are
most popular among the StumbleUpon community have to
do with rather artistic content (“ytmnd”, “fmylife”, “ﬂying
spaghetti monster”, “where the hell is matt”, “mystery guitar
man”). This is in contrast to the most popular memes determined from Delicious which coincide with memes that are
known for their considerable popularity and wide circulation
on the Internet. We therefore conjecture that users of recommendation engines are more after sophisticated content than
after mundane jokes or fads.

are known from data on daily infectious rates of epidemics
and are often studied using stochastic models. In this section, we investigate the use of two classes of models and
argue that and why log-normal distributions are well suited
to represent the temporal dynamics of Internet memes.

Compartment Models
Compartment models are an established approach to describe the progress of an epidemic in a large population.
Typically, the population is thought of as being divided into
disjoint fractions of those who are susceptible (S) to the disease, those who are infectious (I), and those who have recovered (R). Some models consider further compartments
but they all assume that an individual belongs to one group
only. Transitions between groups are constrained by the
structure of the model; the SIRS model, for instance, is concerned with transitions of the form S → I → R → S which
are governed by the following differential equations

Modeling Meme Dynamics
In part, the work reported in this paper was motivated by
a striking observation made while tracking Internet memes
using Google Insights: the query frequencies for almost every meme known to have originated later than January 2004
were displayed as a positively skewed curve with a considerably long tail (see again Fig. 3). Characteristics like these

Ṡ(t) = −βI(t)S(t) + φR(t)

Ṙ(t) = νI(t) − φR(t)

where S(0) = 1−, I(0) = , and R(0) = 0. The parameter
β is the rate of infection, ν is the rate of recovery, and φ
denotes the average loss of immunity.
Slightly simpler models (of type SI, SIS, SIR) have been
used to study information dissemination within web-based

different Internet memes. The examples in the top row show pathological cases that are not well accounted for by either model.

and Huberman 2007; Crane and Sornette 2008). They implicitly provide means for the modeling of time-dependent
growth and decline rates and therefore appear as an auspicious alternative in studying the temporal dynamics of Internet memes.
A random variable x is log-normally distributed, if log(x)
has a normal distribution. Accordingly, the probability density function of such a random variable is

communities (Kubo et al. 2007; Myers and Leskovec 2010)
and were reported to give a good account of the interaction
dynamics in social networks. We therefore examined the
use of stochastic compartment approaches (SIR, SEIR, and
SIRS) in modeling the temporal dynamics of meme spread.
The general assumption is that meme related time series
x = [xto , . . . , xT ] available from Google Insights correspond to the infectious rates I(t) of epidemic processes.
Note, however, that systems of differential equations as
in (3) – (5) are nonlinear so that model ﬁtting is non-trivial.
In order to estimate the parameters that would ﬁt a compartment model to a time series of meme related search frequencies, we therefore resorted to Markov Chain Monte Carlo
methods. Given observational data for a meme, we generated 1000 proposal distributions using random parameterizations of a compartment model. Suitable parameters that
would match the infectious rates of the model to the given
time series were then determined in an iterative weighted resampling process. Among the tested compartment models,
we found SIRS type models to provide the best explanations
of meme activity data.
Figure 6 shows examples of corresponding best matching curves. We note that SIRS models reproduces the general behavior of memes, but, in particular for memes that
are characterized by bursty activities, tend to underestimate
the early early contagious stages of the meme. This indicates that stochastic compartment models with constant parameters lack the ﬂexibility required to accurately describe
the temporal dynamics of Internet memes. While variants
with time-dependent parameters might add further ﬂexibility, they would disproportionately increase the difﬁculty of
parameter estimation.

The distribution is only deﬁned for positive values, skewed
to the left, and often long-tailed. The mean μ and standard
deviation σ of log(x) deﬁne the exact form of the curve.
It can be shown that log-normal distributions are generated by multiplicative processes. Such processes are commonly applied to describe growth and decline in biological
or economic systems. Suppose a process starts with a quantity of size x0 which then, at each time t, may grow or shrink
in terms of a percentage of its current size. In other words,
the process is governed by a time-dependent random variable γt such that
xt = γt xt−1 .
(7)
Although multiplicative processes and their corresponding log-normal distributions are known to provide accurate
models for a variety of Internet related phenomena (Mitzenmacher 2004; Downey 2005), we are not aware of any previous work where they would have been used to study the
characteristics of Internet memes.
For each of the 150 time series x = [xto , . . . , xT ] that
were obtained from Google Insights, we determined the best
ﬁtting log-normal distribution using least squares optimization. Table 1 lists the resulting parameters μ and σ for a subset of 120 memes and Fig. 6 illustrates the behavior of six
of the models we obtained this way. Overall, we found lognormal distributions to provide a highly accurate account of
the temporal dynamics of the memes under consideration.

model frequency distributions of bookmarks or recommendations as well as to characterize response dynamics of social systems (Wu and Huberman 2007; Lescovec, Adamic,

quality ﬁt, the log-normal model still provides an acceptable
description of the general behavior of the meme. Cases for
which both models yield a rather poor account typically correspond to memes that are characterized by either a single
burst of popularity or by sequences of such bursts usually
due to rekindled interest after news reports in other media.
The majority of Internet memes, however, are characterized
by time series that are positively skewed and long-tailed. In
these cases, as well as for memes that appear not to have
reached peak popularity yet, log-normal distributions provide accurate descriptions (see the lower row in Fig. 6).

Implications and Application to Prediction
1000

At this point is important to note that, in contrast to stochastic compartment models such as the SIRS model, log-normal
approximations do not model processes and mechanisms of
meme spread but summarize corresponding time series.
Nevertheless, the good quality of log-normal ﬁts to meme
related time series provides interesting insights. Work by
Dover, Goldberg, and Shapira (2010) has established connections between temporal observations of rates of infection
(by rumors or marketing messages) and network topologies
or links structures of social groups. In particular, it was
shown that temporally log-normal diffusion rates indicate
networks of log-normal link distributions. In the context of
meme spread on the Internet, this is interesting, because it
has been observed that although the Internet globally constitutes a scale free graph, it locally consists of homogeneous sub-graphs of log-normal connectivity (Pennock et
al. 2002). Therefore, at least for the majority of Internet
memes whose temporal penetration data is well represented
by log-normal distributions, we conjecture that they spread
through rather homogenous communities of similar interests
and preferences instead of through the Internet at large.
An immediate application of log-normal models of meme
related time series is to apply the resulting descriptions in
order to produce a compressed representation of memes in
the space spanned by the shape parameters μ and σ. Figure 8 shows the corresponding two-dimensional embedding
of the 150 memes considered in this paper. We ﬁnd the ma-

Figure 8: Two-dimensional embedding of 150 Internet
memes in (μ, σ) plane where μ and σ are the shape parameters of the log-normal distribution. The majority of memes is
found in a cluster represented by the “salad ﬁngers” meme.
See Fig. 6 for the appearance of the time series of the six
memes whose names are shown here.
In order to quantify this impression, we performed χ2 goodness of ﬁt tests. With respect to all 150 memes considered
here, we found the p-values of SIRS and log-normal models
to exceed a conﬁdence threshold of 0.9 in about 70% of the
cases. Yet, in 83% of the cases, the p-values obtained for
log-normal ﬁts exceeded those of the corresponding SIRS
ﬁts. We also determined the Kullback-Leibler divergence

between each time series x and its best ﬁtting model f . Table 1 lists the resulting DKL measures (closer to 0.0 is better) for SIRS and log-normal ﬁts. In 55% of the cases, we
found the log-normal ﬁts to yield better DKL measures than
the best ﬁtting SIRS model.
The upper row in Fig. 6 indicates that even in pathological cases where χ2 tests and DKL measures signal a low

jority of memes clustered around the “salad ﬁnger” meme
which corroborates the observation that time series of meme
related activities are typically skewed and long-tailed. We
also note a distinct cluster of memes on the top right. These
are memes or Internet phenomena for which the mean μ was
estimated to be large therefore indicating a pattern of still increasing popularity.
The existence of such memes led us to attempt a forecast of their future evolution according to the corresponding
log-normal model. Figure 7 depicts 10-year forecasts for a
collection of six memes or meme related web sites. Certainly, these forecasts will have to be taken with a grain of
salt for they do not envision possibly disruptive events. Nevertheless, our predictions look plausible. In contrast to re-

lated recent work (Yang and Lescovec 2011), they were obtained without having to learn predictive models from large
amounts of data.

Conclusion
The term Internet meme is used to describe evolving content
that rapidly gains popularity or notoriety on the Internet. As
of late, Internet memes have attracted increased public interest and a growing number of web sites and communities
are dedicated to this topic. Moreover, professionals in marketing and campaigning have embraced Internet memes as a
way to build rapport with trendy communities.
Given the growing interest in Internet memes, there is sur-

48

prisingly little scientiﬁc work on the phenomenon so far. In
particular, data-driven models that would allow for characterizing the dynamics of a meme or even for forecasting its
longevity or peak circulation are scarce.
In this paper, we investigated the temporal dynamics and
infectious properties of 150 famous Internet memes. Our
analysis was based on time series that were collected from
Google Insights, Delicious, Digg, and StumbleUpon. From
this data, we identiﬁed distinct interests in the corresponding communities. Among other results, we saw that users of
the Digg social news service predominantly react to recent
memes and users of the StumbleUpon recommendation engine appear to be interested mostly in sophisticated memes.
We also examined the use of different mathematical models of epidemic spread in the context of Internet memes. We
found that elaborate traditional compartment models with
constant parameters give a good account of the growth and
decline patterns of memes yet lack the ﬂexibility to characterize short-lived bursts of meme related activity. Lognormal distributions, on the other hand, implicitly account
for time-dependent growth and decline rates. We found lognormal distributions to yield accurate summaries of the temporal dynamics of Internet memes; in statistical signiﬁcance
tests, we found that for 70% of the 150 memes considered in
this paper the probability of a log-normal model underlying
the observed data distribution exceeded 90%. Taking into
account the fact that log-normal diffusion processes indicate
networks of log-normal link distributions (Dover, Goldberg,
and Shapira 2010) and the observation that the globally scale
free Internet graph appears to contain many log-normal subgraphs (Pennock et al. 2002), we conjecture that the majority of currently famous Internet memes spreads through
homogenous communities and social networks rather than
through the Internet at large.
