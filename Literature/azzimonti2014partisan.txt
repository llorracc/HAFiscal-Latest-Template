Abstract
American politics have become extremely polarized in recent decades. This deep political divide has caused significant government dysfunction. Political divisions make the
timing, size, and composition of government policy less predictable. According to existing
theories, an increase in the degree of economic policy uncertainty or in the volatility of
fiscal shocks results in a decline in economic activity. This occurs because businesses and
households may be induced to delay decisions that involve high reversibility costs. In addition, disagreement between policymakers may result in stalemate, or, in extreme cases,
a government shutdown. This adversely affects the optimal implementation of policy reforms and may result in excessive debt accumulation or inefficient public-sector responses
to adverse shocks. Testing these theories has been challenging given the low frequency
at which existing measures of partisan conflict have been computed. In this paper, I
provide a novel high-frequency indicator of the degree of partisan conflict. The index,
constructed for the period 1891 to 2013, uses a search-based approach that measures the
frequency of newspaper articles that report lawmakers’ disagreement about policy. I show
that the long-run trend of partisan conflict behaves similarly to political polarization and
income inequality, especially since the Great Depression. Its short-run fluctuations are
highly related to elections, but unrelated to recessions. The lower-than-average values
observed during wars suggest a “rally around the flag” effect. I use the index to study the
effect of an increase in partisan conflict, equivalent to the one observed since the Great
Recession, on business cycles. Using a simple VAR, I find that an innovation to partisan
conflict increases government deficits and significantly discourages investment, output,
and employment. Moreover, these declines are persistent, which may help explain the
slow recovery observed since the 2007 recession ended.

Introduction

American politics have become increasingly polarized in recent decades (see McCarty, Poole,
and Rosenthal, 2006)1 . Intense partisan conflict, combined with a divided government, has led
to significant Congressional gridlock, such as the budgetary warfare that eventually triggered
the 18th government shutdown in US history in 2013. Political divisions are relevant for the
evolution of economic variables because they make the timing, size, and composition of fiscal
policy less predictable. This negatively affects households’ and firms’ investment decisions,
particulary those involving high reversibility costs (e.g., entry and exit decisions, real estate
purchases, hiring under search costs, etc.). As a result, output and employment decline. In
addition, legislative gridlock affects the optimal timing of policy reforms. As suggested by
Alesina and Drazen (1991), this could result in inefficient accumulation of debt. The degree
to which increasing conflict between policymakers affects the evolution of economic variables
is difficult to quantify given that existing measures are available only at low frequencies
(mostly at a biannual level). Identification of its effects over the business cycle thus becomes
challenging.
In this paper, I construct a novel measure of the degree of partisan conflict (PC). The
methodology is similar to that developed by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2013) for computing
economic policy uncertainty. It uses a search-based approach that measures the frequency of
newspaper coverage of articles reporting political disagreement about government policy—
both within and between national parties—normalized by the total number of news articles
within a given period. Analyzing the historical series—covering the period 1891-2013—I find
that PC scores declined between 1891 and the early 1920s, remained relatively stable until
1965, and exhibited an increasing trend thereafter. The rise in partisan conflict accelerated
during the Great Recession, peaking with the 2013 government shutdown.
This pattern is consistent with the evolution of political polarization (computed by McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal, 2006) and with the behavior of income inequality, measured by
the share of income held by the top 1%. In addition, changes in the PC trend tend to be
larger under a divided government and are positively related to the share seats in Congress
controlled by the President’s party. I find that short-term increases in partisan conflict are associated with presidential elections and well-known fiscal policy debates, such as the approval
of Obamacare, the debt ceiling debate, and the fiscal cliff. This is reassuring, suggesting that
the indicator captures disagreement about well-known polemic issues. No clear relationship
between partisan conflict and recessions is detected. For example, the index was much lower
than average during the Great Depression, but reached significant levels during the panics
of 1893 and 1911, and the Great Recession. While the increasing trend starting in the 1960s
coincides with the one documented for economic policy uncertainty (see Baker, Bloom, and
Davis, 2013), the two series behave very differently before this period, in particular during
the Great Depression. Interestingly, partisan conflict subsides when the country is at war
or subject to national security threats, such as World War I, Pearl Harbor, and 9/11 (the
1

Bonica and Rosenthal (2013a) find similar results using the pattern of contributions made by legislators’
supporters. Jensen, Kaplan, Naidu, and Wilse-Samson (2012) provide independent evidence of this, analyzing
political discourse from Google Books and the digitalized Congressional Record during this period.

Vietnam War being an exception). This suggests that American politics are very polarized
regarding economic policy, but less divided when it comes to national defense issues. It also
indicates the presence of a partisan “rally around the flag” effect.
To quantify the effects of increasing partisan conflict on the real economy, I focus on the
period 1981-2013, where a wider set of newspapers becomes available and a more precise
search using filters can be performed. These filters allow me to exclude opinion articles,
editorials, or international news. I analyze changes in deficits, employment, output, and
investment that result from a 72-point innovation to PC scores (equivalent to the increase
in the index between 2006 and 2013). I find a deficit of $54.2 billion upon impact and $79.4
billion in the subsequent quarter. This is consistent with Alesina and Drazen’s (1991) theory
of delayed stabilization, where stalemate induces deficit creation. Employment decreases as
a result of the shock, with a peak loss of 1.52 million jobs after six quarters. Investment
decreases 9.7% after three quarters, and output shrinks about 1.4%. Intuitively, intense
partisan conflict is associated with high volatility of fiscal policy (Azzimonti and Talbert,
2013). This deters economic activity because it increases economic policy uncertainty (Baker,
Bloom, and Davis, 2013; Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramı́rez, 2010). The declines
documented in this paper are not only large but also persistent, which may help explain part
of the slow recovery following the Great Recession.
The paper is organized as follows. A description of how the partisan conflict indicator
was constructed is included in Section 2. Section 3 describes the main determinants in the
long-run trends in partisan conflict, as well as on its short-term fluctuations. The connections
between partisan conflict and economic policy uncertainty are discussed in Section 4, with
robustness being analyzed in Section 5. Section 6 quantifies the effects of partisan conflict in
the economy for the sub-sample 1981-2013, and Section 7 concludes.

Measuring partisan conflict

The main objective of this section is to construct an indicator of the degree of partisan conflict to analyze how it evolves over time, understand its determinants, and later assess how
it effects the real economy. Existing proxies of political disagreement lack important dimensions associated with the political game that are relevant to the household’s decision-making
process. For example, measures based on poll data of voters’ ideological differences (such
as those developed by the Pew Research Center survey on values or Gallup) do not reflect
the fact that voters’ preferences may not be well represented in office due to the influence
of interest groups or politicians’ own agendas. Measures of legislators’ ideological differences
based on roll-call data or congressional records (McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal, 2006; Bonica and Rosenthal, 2013b; or Jensen, et al. 2013) ignore filibuster threats and presidential
vetoes, which constitute important sources of policy determination. The interaction between
the executive and legislative branches, or between the House and the Senate under a divided
government, may be an important factor affecting private-sector decisions. Finally, while
frequent political turnover is suggestive of partisan conflict, political instability measures
(such as those developed by the World Bank, the IMF, or ICRG’s Political Risk Services)
completely disregard the intensity of ideological differences. This paper takes on a different
3

approach by analyzing the coverage of political news to create an indicator of the degree of
partisan conflict. In doing so, it attempts to fill a gap in the literature by quantifying a more
comprehensive measure at higher frequencies.

2.1

Index construction

I follow a methodology similar to that in Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2013) in constructing an
indicator of partisan conflict. In particular, I use a search-based approach that measures the
frequency of newspaper articles reporting political disagreement about government policy.
The identification assumption underlying the index is that greater media coverage of ideologically divisive issues, legislative gridlock, presidential vetoes, or filibuster threats indicates
intense disagreement between policymakers (either across party lines or within a party).
I will compute two indexes: Historical Partisan Conflict, covering the period 1891-2013,
and a benchmark measure, Partisan Conflict, covering the interval 1981-2013.
Historical Partisan Conflict is computed annually using news articles from five major
newspapers that have been digitalized since 1891: The Wall Street Journal, The New York
Times, Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post. The advantage of
this measure is that it allows us to characterize the long-run trend in partisan conflict and
compare it with other slow-moving variables such as polarization. The main disadvantage is
that the search cannot be refined to the same degree as the benchmark case is. While we can
restrict the search over actual articles (excluding, for example, advertisements or obituaries),
we cannot restrict it to domestic news.
The search used in the construction of Partisan Conflict is performed in Factiva (by
Dow Jones). An advantage of using Factiva’s search engine versus the ones provided by
each particular newspaper is that the search outcome is homogeneous and an identical set of
predefined filters can be applied. In particular, I restrict the search to major US newspapers
(see Table 4 in Appendix 8.1 for a full list of sources included) with news written exclusively
in English and restricted to events occurring in, or related to, the US. The top news sources
resulting from the search are The Washington Post, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times,
Chicago Tribune, The Wall Street Journal, Newsday, The Dallas Morning News, the Boston
Globe, and Tampa Bay Times (see Figure 19 in Appendix 8.1 for a decomposition of sources).
In addition, I exclude editorials and commentaries from the search in an attempt to reduce
potential ideological biases (see the work by Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010, on media slant).
Routine general news, reviews, interviews, etc. are also excluded in order to reduce the
incidence of false positives. A comprehensive list of filters applied can be found in Appendix
8.2. Because the search is more precise, the benchmark measure—rather than the historical
series—will be used to quantify the effects of partisan conflict on the economy.
The index is computed as follows. First, I count the number of articles that discuss
disagreement between political parties, branches of government, or political actors (e.g. candidates not yet in office, legislators, etc.) in a given interval of time. In particular, I search for
articles containing at least one keyword in the following two categories: (i) political disagreement and (ii) government. Figure 1 summarizes the resulting terms used in each category. I
focus on articles including keywords at the intersection of those two categories. In addition,
I also search for specific terms related to partisan conflict, such as “divided party,” “parti4

san divisions,” and “divided Congress.” Note that the search involves terms related to the
political debate (e.g., “fail to compromise”), as well as the outcome of the partisan warfare
(e.g. “gridlock” and “filibuster”).
The search captures disagreement not only about economic policy (e.g., related to budgetary decisions, tax rates, deficit levels, welfare programs, etc.), but also about private-sector
regulation (e.g., financial and immigration reform), national defense issues (e.g., wars, terrorism), and other dimensions that divide policymakers’ views (e.g., same-sex marriage, gun
control, abortion rights, among others). A representative article that the search picks up can
be seen in Appendix 8.3.

Notes: The term “X committee” stands for Appropriations Committee, Finance Committee, or

The particular words included in each category were chosen using a two-stage procedure.
In the first stage, I selected words normally used in the political economy and political science
literatures that refer to political disagreement. From the outcome of this first-stage search,
three articles per month over the period 1981-2013 were selected at random from the New
York Times and thoroughly read. Additional words used by the media were incorporated
into the initial search in a second stage. The objective of this refinement was to reduce the
incidence of false negatives. Some of the original keywords were eliminated in order to reduce
false positives. The words “polarization” and “dysfunctional” are excluded from the historical
search because these words entered the media language only in the 1980s. The remaining
words were observed with a relatively constant frequency in the historical newspapers (using
10-year intervals). In addition “political” and “disagreement” have also been excluded from
the historical search because they retrieved a disproportionate amount of foreign news. This
shortcoming does not arise in the benchmark search where we can restrict it to domestic
articles.

Because the volume of digitized news varies over time, I scale the raw partisan conflict
count by the total number of articles in the same newspapers over the same time interval.
To do this in the benchmark index, I perform a search every month from January 1981
to December 2013 containing the word “today.”2 For the historical series, I divide the raw
partisan conflict count by the number of articles every year that contain the word “the,” rather
than “today,” due to the fact that, early in the sample, there was usually a delay between the
date on which an event happened and the date on which it was reported. Finally, I normalize
PC scores to average 100 in the year 1990. The historical index is shown in Figure 2 3 .

The evolution of partisan conflict

What explains the evolution of partisan conflict? Partisan conflict results from the interaction
between two parties with different objectives in the political arena. We can think of it as
being determined by the following generic function:
P C = f (polarization, political power, shocks).
Policymakers’ ideological differences, or polarization, are clearly an important determinant of political disagreement. The further apart parties’ views over policy are, the higher
the level of conflict should be. How political power is divided between the two parties must
also affect the degree of conflict. Consider the extreme case of one particular party controlling both chambers of Congress and the presidency. Then partisan conflict should be low,
regardless of how ideologically divided parties are. Finally, there are expected and unexpected shocks that might affect the level of PC at a particular point in time. Elections are an
example of expected shocks: While the outcome of an election is unknown, the date at which
the uncertainty is resolved is not. Unexpected shocks are wars and business cycle fluctuations
(booms and recessions).
In this section, we characterize the relationship between these variables and partisan
conflict. Because they affect PC at different frequencies, the analysis will be divided into
two parts: (i) the long-run trend and (ii) short-term fluctuations. To isolate long-run trends
from short-term fluctuations, I apply an HP-filter (with weight w = 6.25, as in Ravn and
Uhlig, 2002) to the series.4 Figure 3 shows the evolution of the resulting two components of
partisan conflict.

3.1

Long-run trend

Partisan conflict declined between 1891 and the early 1920s, remained relatively stable until
1965, and exhibited an increasing trend thereafter, as seen from Figure 2. The rise in partisan
conflict accelerated during the Great Recession, peaking with the 2013 government shutdown.

Using the word “the” to count the total number of articles instead causes no noticeable difference in the
index.

HP filtering has been chosen rather than first differences because the trend is not completely removed
from the series when using differences. Using a smoothing parameter of w = 100 also resulted in slow-moving
trends observed in the residual. More details are available from the author upon request.

Figure 3: Partisan conflict, HP-filtered (w = 6.25).

Polarization Polarization is possibly one of the most important factors (although not the
only one) determining partisan conflict. We should expect partisan conflict to intensify when
political polarization rises. Intuitively, it should be more difficult for parties to agree on the
course of social and economic policy when their ideological differences are large. Interestingly,
McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2006) document that polarization between political parties
has risen significantly in the postwar era. Its causes and consequences are summarized by
Barber and McCarty (2013). This pattern is consistent with the sustained increase in partisan
conflict scores over the same period, as shown in Figure 4.
While both series exhibit a decline early in the sample, partisan conflict decreases at
a much faster rate and lies below polarization until the 72nd Congress. There are two
potential explanations for this. One is that news-reporting styles changed over time. For
example, if newspapers were highly partisan early in the sample (e.g., less independent), PC
scores could be underestimated. Increasing competition from alternative news outlets, such
as TV, radio, and more recently the internet, may have induced newspapers to emphasize
conflict. The second possibility is that while ideological differences influence the extent of
disagreement between policymakers, there are other factors beyond polarization that are
relevant to determining partisan conflict. Because PC scores identify political outcomes
rather than policymakers’ preferences, the measure is likely to be affected by the division of
power between the two parties across different branches of government. Whether Congress
is divided or not, as well as the degree of influence exerted by the President in Congress,
could be important determinants of the outcome of the political game. Notice that gridlock is
usually observed in instances where two political parties share power in the legislature, rather
than in cases where one party controls both chambers of Congress and/or the presidency (see
Binder, 1999). Vetoes are an important instrument used by Presidents when they do not have
a majority to block a particular bill. This suggests that the disparities observed between
polarization and partisan conflict could be due to changes in government composition—

affecting the decision-making power of each party—even if their ideological views remained
unchanged. To see this, note that between the 63rd and the 71st Congresses, a period
where the two series diverge the most, both chambers had a Democratic majority. Even if
partisan divisions were large, de facto disagreement, as measured by PC scores, was not.
Since economic agents’ decisions depend on expected policy (i.e., the outcome of the political
game), partisan conflict may be a more relevant indicator of policy-relevant disagreement
than existing measures of polarization.
Power structure I conjecture that polarization and political power affect PC scores differently, a hypothesis that will be tested further. I proxy the decision-making power of each
party with two variables. The first one, Divided is a dichotomic variable that equals 1 when a
party has a majority in the House and the other party a majority in the Senate. The second
one, Pres Seats i, denotes the share of seats in i = {House, Senate} held by the President’s
party. Political polarization is obtained from McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2006; see note
in Figure 4 for more details).
Because polarization exhibits almost no short-run fluctuations and is measured bi-annually,
I will focus only on the effects of the trend in polarization on the trend of partisan conflict,
deferring the discussion of cycles to the next section. All the continuous variables (e.g.,
polarization, partisan conflict, and share of seats) are detrended using an HP filter.

Notes: The dependent variable is the first difference in the trend of partisan
conflict. The independent variables in specification (1) are Idiv,c and the first
difference of the polarization trend. Specification (2) includes the first difference
in the trend component of the share of seats controlled by the President’s party
in the House, ∆P res Seats Hc , while specification (3) includes the equivalent
measure in the Senate, ∆P res Seats Sc . Sample period is 1891-2012. Each observation corresponds to a Congress. Robust standard errors are in parentheses.
*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Both coefficients are positive and statistically significant, indicating that polarization
and partisan conflict are positively related and that PC scores are higher under a divided
Congress. The second specification shows that partisan conflict declines as the share of seats
controlled by the President’s party in the House rises. The share of seats controlled in the
Senate has no significant impact on partisan conflict according to the results of specification
(3), since the coefficient of ∆P res Seats Sc is statistically insignificant.
Income inequality Another variable frequently associated with political disagreement is
income inequality. When income is unequally distributed, disagreement over redistributive
policy is likely to arise in a democratic society, intensifying partisan conflict. Figure 5 shows
10

that the evolution of partisan conflict is remarkably similar to that of income inequality,
proxied by the share of income held by the top 1%, in the postwar period. The increase in
inequality observed since the late 1960s may be an important determinant of the rising trend
in partisan conflict. This is consistent with McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2003), who show
that partisanship became more stratified by income between 1956 and 1996. Prior to this
period, according to the authors, race and religion (rather than income and wealth) were the
dominant determinants of political ideology.

Figure 5: Partisan conflict and income inequality, 1944-2012.
Notes: Income inequality measured by the share of income held by the top 1%,
from Alvaredo, Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez’s dataset. Data downloaded from
http://topincomes.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/.

Causality, however, cannot be established, as argued by McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal
(2006). According to the authors, political disagreement can also affect income inequality
by hampering support for redistributive policies. This view is supported by the behavior
of partisan conflict and inequality in the late 1920s. Figure 5 shows that income inequality
peaks right before the Great Depression, but exhibits a declining trend starting in 1929.
Initially, inequality lowers due to the erosion of wealth in the top percentiles following the
stock market crash. In addition, corporate taxes were raised and the top-bracket tax rate was
increased from 25% to 63% under Hoover’s presidency. This resulted in further reductions
in the share of income held by the top 1%. From 1933 onwards, the size of the welfare state
was expanded to unprecedented levels in US history under the New Deal. Interestingly, these
novel redistributive policies were approved in a period of unusually low levels of partisan
conflict. PC scores were low for two reasons. First, polarization declined sharply during
the 74th Congress (e.g., between 1935 to 1937) under Roosevelt’s presidency (see Figure 4).
11

Second, both chambers had a Democratic supermajority.
We conclude that the relationship between the trend observed in partisan conflict and
that of inequality is not coincidental. Low levels of partisan conflict ease the implementation
of policies that reduce inequality, while low inequality creates incentives for parties to move
toward the center. An example of the latter is given by the Democratic realignment that
resulted from the New Deal.

3.2

Short-run fluctuations

In this section we will abstract from the long-run trend in partisan conflict, focusing on
short-term fluctuations instead (denoted by “cycle” in Figure 3).
Elections The most natural source of short-run fluctuations in the PC indicator is the
arrival of election dates. This is seen clearly in Figure 6, which displays the evolution of the
refined monthly measure of partisan conflict between 1981 and 2013 (solid line). The circles
indicate months associated with presidential elections (either when the election is held or
the month previous), while the vertical bars represent those in which Congress held midterm
elections.
We should expect the index to be higher than average during elections purely for mechanical reasons: Newspapers increase the proportion of articles covering political debates and
emphasize differences between candidates during those periods. In addition, partisan conflict
may also intensify endogenously, as legislators try to pursue a particular agenda or block
specific legislation to tilt election results in their party’s favor (see Gilmour, 1995; Groseclose
and McCarty, 2001 on strategic disagreement). All agents in the political game (incumbent
legislators, the opposition, the President, etc.) have incentives to exaggerate their positions
to signal a particular type in an attempt to attract votes. To test whether this is indeed the
case, a two-sided t-test was performed with results summarized in Table 2.5 The first column
in the table displays the mean value of historical PC scores in off-election years, while the
second column shows the mean in election years. On average, partisan conflict scores are
significantly higher when presidential elections are held, even at the 5% level (the p-values
associated with the test are presented in the fourth column).
We cannot reject the hypothesis, however, that PC scores during midterm election years
are the same as those in off-election periods. This result should be taken with caution,
however, since there is a midterm election every other year in the historical sample. When
shorter intervals are analyzed (e.g., at a monthly frequency), periods surrounding a midterm
election are indeed characterized by higher partisan conflict. The results of the test using the
benchmark measure of partisan conflict, computed monthly, are summarized at the bottom
of Table 2. An “election period” is defined by an indicator variable that takes a value of 1
in the month in which an election takes place or the month prior, and zero otherwise. The
rationale for including the month before an election is that sometimes elections are held early
in the month, implying that most of the news associated with the event is documented the
5

ANOVA tests were also conducted for robustness, and the findings are consistent with the results in this
table.

while the fourth row shows this average in election periods (e.g., the month when an election takes place

t-test (unequal variances) for each mean. PC scores are detrended using an HP filter (w = 6.25).

month before. In this case, both midterm elections and presidential elections are associated
with higher-than-average detrended partisan conflict.
Recessions The state of the economy could potentially be a factor affecting the pattern of
PC scores in the short run. For example, recessions are periods when automatic stabilizers
(such as unemployment benefits) kick in. Several of these stabilizers are highly redistributive
in nature and thus potentially conflictive. We should expect partisan conflict to intensify
in “bad times,” when revenues tend to be low and spending needs are large. An example
is the 2007 recession, when the subsequent conflict over tax-cut expirations led to gridlock
and hence extreme values in the PC index. When testing this hypothesis over the period
1891-2013, however, I found no evidence that partisan conflict is higher during recessions
than in normal times. The results of a two-sided t-test are relegated to Appendix 8.4, Table
5. I also tested whether these results were an artifact of the low values of PC scores observed
during the Great Depression, but even when the Great Depression is excluded I found no
effect of recessions on PC scores.
Notice that these results rely on annual data for the historical series. It would be interesting to know whether recessions affect partisan conflict at a quarterly frequency.
Wars Following Mueller (1973), a large strand of the political science literature has analyzed the effects of dramatic and sharply focused international crises (or war) on the popular
support of the President of the United States. The unprecedented increase in George W.
Bush’s public approval ratings, from 51% to 86% following the September 11th terrorist attacks, is a typical example of the ‘rally around the flag” effect. Interestingly, PC reached the

14

lowest level since 1981 on September 11, when it decreased dramatically from the spike associated with the Bush versus Gore election. Partisan rallies around the flag are also observed
in the benchmark series (see Figure 6) during the Beirut and Oklahoma City bombings and
both Gulf Wars.
We also observe lower-than-average PC scores during episodes of war and national security
threats in the historical series. The clearest examples are given by the First War World and
the Second War World in Figure 2. Mathews (1919) argues that one effect of war upon
the party system (...) is to bring about, at least for a time, a relatively greater stability of
party control, if not complete quiescence of partisanship, either through coalition or through
cessation of party opposition, or both.
To test his theory more formally, I construct a dummy variable, war, which takes a value
of 1 if there is more than 1 military death per 100,000 people in the population in a given year
and 0 otherwise.6 This variable captures, for example, the Spanish-American War, WWI,
WWII, the Korean War, and the most violent years of the Vietnam war. Table 3 shows
that wartime is indeed associated with significantly lower-than-average (detrended) partisan
conflict.

Note: The first row displays the mean value of detrended historical PC scores during wars, while the
second row shows this average in peacetime. Each
observation corresponds to a year over the interval
1891-2013. The last row documents the p-value associated with a two-sided t-test (unequal variances)
for each mean. PC scores are detrended using an HPfilter (w = 6.25).

Taken together, the results indicate that political parties disagree more about economic
policy than about defense issues. Suggestive evidence supporting this claim is given by
disapproval ratings, discussed in more detail in Appendix 8.5.
One may argue that lower PC scores are observed during wars because newspapers devote
a larger percentage of coverage to documenting events related to the war itself, rather than
to government policy. Inspection of the evolution of the economic policy uncertainty (EPU)
index, computed by Baker et.al. (2013), suggests that this is not the case, as their series
increases significantly during these events. An example is given by the large spike in EPU
observed during 9/11, a period where partisan conflict reached record lows (relative to trend).
This will be discussed in more detail in the next section, where I contrast the evolution of

partisan conflict to that of EPU.
Issues Another source of short-term fluctuations is given by the occurrence of polemic
issues in the legislative agenda over which a decision must be taken. This feature was noted
as early as 1902 by Laurence Lowell, who stated ...the amount of party voting depends largely
upon the accident of some question in which the parties are sharply divided happening to come
up for decision...in England, parties frame the issues. In America the issues do not, indeed,
make the parties, but determine the extent of their opposition to each other in matters of
legislation.
Figure 7 depicts the benchmark PC scores together with a series of tax expirations obtained from Baker et al. (2013). The figure illustrates that partisan conflict intensifies when
Congress is forced to make a dated decision affecting the federal budget, triggered by one
of these expirations. The monthly correlation between the two series is 0.7. A higher-thannormal sequence of tax expirations since 2007 could then explain the increase in partisan
conflict over the same period.

Figure 7: Partisan conflict and tax expirations.

At very short frequencies, the partisan conflict index will capture not only general ideological differences in the liberal-conservative spectrum, but also the degree of disagreement over
particular topics. The government shutdown of 1995, the passage of “Obamacare,” the debt
ceiling debate, and the period surrounding the fiscal cliff are notable examples (see Figure
6). These issues not only are divisive, but also important for individual decision-making and
thus receive extensive coverage in the news.
At a particular point in time, it is impossible, unfortunately, to disentangle whether
partisan conflict is high because parties are ideologically far apart on a particular issue from
16

the relevance of the issue per se. Polarization levels cannot, therefore, be inferred from
PC levels at very short frequencies (as in the benchmark indicator, where PC is computed
monthly). The index can be a better indicator of polarization over longer time spans (as in
the case of the historical series) where specific issues are “averaged out.”

are normalized to 100 in 1990.

Differences Even though the methodology used to compute PC is similar to the one by
Baker et.al. (2013) followed to construct EPU, the two indices represent different concepts,
and as such are characterized by distinctive features. In contrast to partisan conflict, EPU
tends to rise during recessions. A clear example is given by the large spike in EPU observed during the Great Depression (see Figure 8), a period when historical partisan conflict
remained basically unchanged.
In addition, EPU is affected by financial shocks (such as Lehman’s collapse or the series of
defaults in Latin American countries) and monetary policy (such as interest rate cuts by the
Federal Reserve), while PC scores are completely nonresponsive to them. This is reasonable,
as those events are unrelated to government policy but do introduce economic uncertainty
about monetary policy, chosen by an independent authority. Figure 9, which depicts the
benchmark measure of PC (solid line) together with the news-based EPU index (dashed

line), illustrates this point. Another important difference results from the behavior of the
two variables in the presence of military conflict: While the EPU increases during wars or
under national security threats (for example, 9/11 or the Gulf Wars), partisan conflict tends
to remain relatively low or even decrease. The fact that EPU increases sharply during these
events indicates the existence of a substantial proportion of newspaper articles discussing
government policy. These articles are not, however, related to conflict between parties. This
suggests that lower-than-average PC scores during international conflicts do indeed reflect
rallies around the flag, rather than just being a by-product of changes in media coverage
toward war-related news.
Because of these factors, the correlation between partisan conflict and the news-based
index of economic policy uncertainty developed by Baker et.al. (2013) is only 0.44.7
Does partisan conflict cause EPU? There exist two types of economic policy uncertainty. The first one relates to uncertainty over which policies would be chosen at each point
in time. The second one is associated with the consequences of policies that have already
been chosen by the government. Partisan conflict causes only the first type of uncertainty.
7

This correlation is computed using only the news-based index of economic policy uncertainty and not the
final EPU. The reason is that tax expirations account for about one-third of the EPU index, which I wanted
to exclude to make the comparison. If I use the benchmark EPU measure, which includes tax expirations, the
correlation between the two indexes is about 0.5.

18

Examples are the debt ceiling debate (will the government change taxes to avoid a fiscal
cliff?), the passage of Obamacare (will Congress modify the health care system?), or the
uncertainty associated with tax expirations (will tax cuts expire or will the two parties agree
on further extensions?). Other episodes, such as the Great Depression, 9/11, or the Iraq
wars, were very different in nature. The policies faced little or no opposition, in a period of
low PC. For example, the New Deal was easily approved with a Democratic supermajority
in both houses. The response to the terrorist attacks in 2001 was clearly a bipartisan effort.
Economic policy uncertainty resulted from doubts over whether the implemented policies
would be effective (to end the Great Depression, to discourage further attacks, or to avoid a
war with other Middle-Eastern countries).
In addition, PC need not always cause economic policy uncertainty. Under extreme
levels of partisan disagreement (e.g., when Congress is divided and polarization levels are
high) the government may enter gridlock state. If the status quo remains unchanged due to
government inaction, there is full policy certainty. Therefore, we should expect PC scores to
increase significantly during a shutdown, but economic policy uncertainty to remain at low
levels. This is consistent with the behavior of the benchmark and historical series (Figures 8
and 9). When Congressional deadlock is accompanied by policy expirations (as in Figure 7),
however, we should expect both EPU and partisan conflict to move in tandem. The deadline
forces policymakers to reach a decision regarding whether or not to continue the policy by a
particular date. This, in turn, increases uncertainty about the course of economic policy.
Finally, EPU may result from other factors that are unrelated to government policy, and
thus unrelated to partisan conflict. Examples are uncertainty over monetary policy or over
policy decisions that might be taken by foreign governments.

5

Robustness

In this subsection I analyze whether the benchmark PC indicator is robust to restricting the
search to involve specific terms related to fiscal policy and to seasonally adjusting the series
by subtracting the average effects of elections.
Robustness to the set of words The article search focuses on political disagreement,
without being specific about particular policy terms. For a robustness check, I recomputed
the historical index conditioning articles to involve specific public policies. The index is
computed using articles containing at least one word at the intersection of the following three
categories: (i) political disagreement, (ii) government, and (iii) public policy. The terms
involved in the first two categories are identical to the ones used to construct the historical
index. The list of terms used in the third category can be found in Appendix 8.6.8
On average, these articles correspond to about 60% of the total number of counts obtained
in the original search, with the ratio increasing to over 76% since 2006.
8
The list includes all the policy terms used in Baker et.al. (2013), plus the following additional terms: tax
(taxation, taxes, taxed), budget, war, constitutional amendment, immigration, sovereign debt, monometallist,
bimetallist, (silver or gold) coinage, duty (or duties), alcohol (or liquor) prohibition, federal credit, grant in
aid, commerce competition, and commerce clause.

Figure 10: Partisan conflict: historical series (dashed) vs. partisan conflict over specific policies
(solid).

The resulting index (computed following the methodology described in Section 2.1), Partisan conflict over policies, can be found together with the historical series in Figure 10.
When conditioning the search to contain specific policy terms, the resulting index is on average lower than the historical one until about 1968, year after which the two series become
virtually identical. This is consistent with the observation that race and religion (rather
than wealth) were the dominant determinants of political ideology before the 1970s. For
example, the policy terms listed above do not capture terms related to the debate on voting
participation that lead to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Seasonally adjusted PC: The spikes in PC scores around election dates described at the
beginning of this section could be due to two factors: (i) partisan conflict increases during
elections or (ii) newspapers dedicate a larger share of coverage to discuss disagreement between candidates. To separate the first effect from the second one, I constructed a “seasonally
adjusted” PC measure. The raw measure of PC is regressed against a constant term and an
indicator variable for each type of election (midterm and presidential),
P Ct = α + βIM,t + γIP,t + ,
where α is a constant, IM = 1 if there is a midterm election and zero otherwise, and IP = 1 if
there is a presidential election;  is an error term. The seasonally adjusted PC is constructed
as
P Csa,t = P Ct − β̂IM,t + γ̂IP,t ,
20

where the hats denote estimated coefficient values. In other words, we subtract the average
increase in the PC during election dates from our benchmark measure. Comparison of the
two series does not result in sizable differences and is therefore omitted (but available upon
request). This indicates that the coverage effect is not the dominant force behind the rise of
partisan conflict.
Alternative normalization In this section, I reconstruct the historical partisan conflict
index by normalizing the series by the total number of articles discussing political news. The
idea is to control for potential changes in news coverage over time. In particular, I divide the
raw partisan disagreement count by the number of articles in the same year that mention
any word related to the government or political parties. For this, I use the set of words in
the “Government” ball in Figure 1.

Figure 11 shows the evolution of this alternative measure (solid line) alongside the benchmark PC (broken line). Both measures spike around the same events, such as the debates
over tariffs and antitrust during 1893 and 1911, respectively, or the 1995 and 2013 shutdowns.
The alternative measure is also relatively low during wars (a formal means-test is available
upon request) and shows no clear relationship with recessions. The cyclical behavior of PC
is therefore analogous to that described for the benchmark PC indicator.
The long-run trends, however, exhibit some differences. In particular, the decline early
in the sample is less marked, and the increase following the 2007 recession is less sharp
in the alternative measure. To understand these differences, it is useful to decompose the

where P D denotes political disagreement (see Figure 1, left ball, for details), G denotes

the evolution of PC into PGD (the alternative PC measure) and G

news).

The slow-moving decline in G
T coincides with the decline in polarization and dominates
the trend of partisan conflict early in the sample; PGD , on the other hand, remains fairly
stable. A similar relationship between these variables is observed following the 1995 shutdown. This suggests that newspapers devote a larger share of news to politics precisely when
there is political disagreement. Recall that one of our main identifying assumptions is that
if partisan conflict is important to the decision-making process of households and firms, it
will be reflected in the news. Because of the endogenous response of newspaper editors to
increase the amount of government news when disagreement is indeed relevant, we feel that
the benchmark PC series is a better indicator of partisan conflict than PGD is.

Consequences of partisan conflict on the economy

There exists a growing literature studying the effects of economic policy uncertainty on the aggregate economy (see, for example Baker, Bloom, and Davis, 2013; Fernández-Villaverde and
Rubio-Ramı́rez, 2010; Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón, Kuester, and Rubio-Ramı́rez, 2012).
A common assumption is that fiscal policy follows an exogenous process where volatility
changes over time. In periods of high variability, economic agents delay hiring, investment,
or production decisions, and this amplifies business cycles.9 Canes-Wrone and Park (2011)
suggest that increases in fiscal uncertainty may be related to the behavior of rational agents
over the electoral cycle. In particular, they argue that businesses and households have incentives to delay decisions that are subject to large reversibility costs right before elections, which
are associated with high levels of economic policy uncertainty. This results in a pre-election
decline in investment, a phenomenon that they refer to as “reverse electoral business cycle
(REC).” In their model, uncertainty tends to be large when there is high electoral competitiveness and sufficient polarization between the major parties, two forces that would result in
higher observed levels of partisan conflict. Azzimonti and Talbert (2013) also propose a theory suggesting that political disagreement affects economic decisions and amplifies business
cycles. They argue that economic fluctuations are caused not only by productivity shocks
(as usually assumed in macroeconomics), but also by “political shocks.” Using a standard
partisan model of fiscal policy determination (a la Persson and Svensson, 1989) embedded
in a neoclassical real business cycle model, they show that switches between left-wing and
right-wing governments amplify the cycle. Moreover, they show that when parties’ ideological
views become further apart, the volatility of fiscal and economic variables rises and long run
output and investment decrease. In their model, partisan conflict increases the variability of
the political shock inducing economic policy uncertainty.
In this section, I explore empirically the effects of partisan conflict on economic behavior.
In particular, I test whether the implications of the models discussed above hold for the US
using the PC measure developed in this paper.

6.1

Economic variables

Economic variables are obtained at the quarterly level for the sample period Q1:1981 to
Q2:2012 from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Consumption, output, and investment are seasonally adjusted and expressed in billions of 2005 dollars. They correspond to
Personal Consumption Expenditures, Gross Domestic Product, and Gross Private Domestic
Investment, respectively, and are converted in real terms using the GDP deflator. Employment is expressed in thousands of employees in the nonfarming sector (seasonally adjusted
series). Interest rates are proxied by quarterly averages of the federal funds (effective) rate,
obtained from the Federal Reserve Board. Finally, I compute the Solow residual to proxy the
contribution of technological progress to output growth in the estimations. This residual is
9
In this paper we are mostly concerned with uncertainty about government policy rather than uncertainty about the state of the economy. This is an important distinction in light of Bachmann, Elstner, and
Sims (2013), who find (using US micro-data) that economic uncertainty is inconsistent with a wait-and-see
hypothesis.

constructed as follows:
St = ln(Yt ) − 0.36 ln(Kt ) − 0.64 ln(Lt ),
where Yt denotes output, Kt is the stock of capital, and Lt is private industries’ employment in
period t. The Solow residual represents the amount of output produced net of expenditures in
the main factors of production: capital and labor. Detrended measures of the Solow residual
capture productivity shocks, which are considered the main factor causing fluctuations in the
economy (i.e., real business cycles) in the macroeconomics literature. In this paper, I want
to distinguish political shocks from technological shocks and will thus use the Solow residual
to control for the latter in the VAR estimations.
The specification above assumes a capital share of 0.36 and a labor share of 0.64, close to
the long-run empirical averages of the capital and labor income shares. The series for capital
is constructed using the perpetual inventory method:
Kt+1 = It + (1 − δ)Kt ,
where δ is a constant depreciation rate of capital (set to 0.012, implying an annual depreciation
rate of about 5%) and It is real investment. The initial capital stock is chosen so that the
capital-to-output ratio in the first period (Q1:1981) equals the average capital-to-output ratio
over our sample period Q1:1981 to Q2:2013,
Q2:2013

The resulting series is then used to compute the Solow residual.

6.2

VAR estimation

To test the impact of partisan conflict on aggregate economic variables, I estimate a vector
auto regression (VAR) model and recover orthogonal shocks by using a Cholesky decomposition of the following: partisan conflict, the Solow residual, the federal funds rate (to control
for interest rates), real deficits, log employment, log investment, log GDP, and log public
spending. In the baseline specification I use quarterly data with two-quarter lags, as suggested by the Bayesian (Schwartz) information criterion test. I check that the VAR is stable,
so impulse-response functions can be constructed. The VAR methodology allows me to detect comovements between economic variables and partisan conflict. I cannot show causality
using a Granger test. This is expected, as it is likely that partisan conflict affects investment
through the uncertainty channel. But it is also possible that low employment levels affect the
degree of conflict across parties. The results below should then be interpreted as “informed
correlations” between a set of variables, rather than assuming partisan conflict is exogenous
to the rest of the economy.
The main experiment is to test the effects of a 72-point increase in the PC, equivalent to
the rise in partisan conflict between Q1:2006 and Q2:2013.

bands. Estimated using a quarterly Cholesky VAR model with PC, the Solow residual, the federal
funds rate, real deficits, log employment, log investment, log GDP, and log public spending (in that
order).

The immediate effect of an increase in PC scores is a $54.2 billion deficit. This is consistent
with Alesina and Drazen’s (1991) theory of delayed stabilization that predicts an increase in
debt as a result of political inaction. The largest effect is observed in the second quarter after
the shock hits, when deficits increase by $79.4 billion.
To the extent that partisan conflict introduces uncertainty about economic policies, theories suggest that we should also observe a decline in investment upon impact. The top panel
of Figure 14 indicates that private investment indeed declines following the rise in partisan
conflict, with a peak impact of about 9.7% after three quarters. This decrease is persistent,
with investment recovering only after eight quarters. The negative response of output can be
seen in the lower panel, which shows a decrease of more than 1% in aggregate production in
response to the 72-point innovation in PC levels. The degree of persistence is lower than for
investment, but it is still considerable.
Figure 18 shows that this innovation causes private employment in the nonfarming sector
to decrease significantly (solid line), with a peak response of 1.52 million jobs lost after six
quarters. The dashed lines in the figure represent one-standard-deviation error bands and
suggest that the decline in employment is statistically significant. The response of public
spending (not shown) is statistically insignificant.

seasonally adjusted indicator of partisan conflict described in Section 3, but this does not
change the results significantly, as seen from the fact that the response of output to PCsa is
basically identical to the response to the benchmark PC measure.
I have also recomputed the VAR including EPU measures. I estimate a VAR and recover
orthogonal shocks by using a Cholesky decomposition of the following: partisan conflict,
EPU, the Solow residual, the federal funds rate (to control for interest rates), real deficits, log
employment, log investment, log GDP, and log public spending. The only difference relative
to the benchmark model is the inclusion of the news-based measure of EPU computed by
Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2013). Figure 17 shows the impulse-response function of output
to partisan conflict (solid line) and to news-based EPU shocks (solid line with triangles). For
reference, I also include the response to a 72-point increase in EPU (solid line with triangles),
which is stronger and more persistent than the response to partisan conflict.
To deal with the potential problem of endogeneity, I recomputed the VAR under alternative orderings of the Cholesky decomposition. Figure 18 depicts three cases. The first figure
(from left to right) shows the benchmark response of investment to a partisan conflict shock
in the benchmark case. The second figure depicts the same response, but where allowing
for TFP shocks to cause partisan conflict, that is, under the following ordering, the Solow
residual, PC, the FF rate, real deficits, log employment, log investment, log GDP, and log
public spending. Investment still goes down when partisan conflict increases. As before, the

effect is significant and persistent. The last figure is computed with PC at the end, that
is: the Solow residual, the FF rate, real deficits, log employment, log investment, log GDP,
log public spending, and PC. Although smaller in magnitude, the effect is still statistically
significant. This extreme case is, of course, unrealistic. But it suggests that even if all other
variables were to affect partisan conflict, an innovation to the unexplained portion of PC
would drive investment down.
This exercise suggests that partisan conflict negatively affects economic behavior. An
increase in the PC similar to that observed between 2006 and 2013 results in a reduction of
output, employment, and investment. Because the estimation controls for TFP (through the
Solow residual), the results suggest that political disagreement exacerbated the detrimental
effects of the last recession in the US. These effects are shown to be persistent and significant,
providing additional support for theories relating partisan conflict to business cycles.

Conclusion

Partisan conflict has increased substantially in the United States since the mid-1970s. Commentators and researchers suggest that the deep ideological division between the two main
parties may have been an important factor affecting the aggregate economy, in particular
by slowing the recovery from the 2007-09 recession. This paper investigates whether these
claims are supported by the data. Because testing the hypothesis requires partisan conflict
to be measured at high frequencies, I first develop a novel index of partisan conflict based on
news search. Using a simple VAR, I test how an innovation to the estimated index (similar in
size to that observed between 2007 and 2013) impacts employment, investment, and output.
I find evidence that political disagreement does cause these variables to decline significantly
and persistently. Intuitively, partisan conflict increases the volatility of fiscal policy, raising
the degree of uncertainty faced by businesses and firms, which has been shown to negatively
affect the economy.
It should not be concluded from this analysis, however, that partisan conflict is welfarereducing regardless of circumstance. Large increases in partisan conflict were recorded following the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as minorities that were previously unrepresented entered
the political arena. The social benefits of this reform clearly outweighed the short-run economic costs that could have resulted from lower investment. In addition, partisan conflict
signals that checks and balances are working as expected in a democratic society. Healthy
discussions around the consequences and effectiveness of particular policies are desirable outcomes of the legislative process. These debates should be reflected, however, as short-run
increases on PC scores. What we have observed over the last few decades is a persistent
increase in partisan conflict instead. The resulting trend is consistent with rising levels of
polarization and increasing income inequality, as shown in the paper. Investigating whether
these coincidental trends are also present in other countries, such as the UK, would be a
fruitful avenue for future research. It would be interesting to see if persistent increases in
partisan conflict are a phenomenon of presidential rather than parliamentary economies, and
what the connection between partisan conflict and inequality would be in a broader set of
countries.
Analyzing the effects of partisan conflict on the US budget cycle (following Alt and
Lassen, 2006) or its effects on the composition of durable and nondurable consumption (as
in Canes-Wrone and Ponce de Leon, 2014) could also be interesting extensions to this work.

SHUTDOWN CAUSED SOME CEOS TO DELAY HIRING FOR SIX MONTHS

The statement
"Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six
months."
President Barack Obama, Oct. 17 in a public address
***
The ruling: MOSTLY TRUE
The White House pointed us to a recent Business Roundtable survey.
"Fift

"Fifty

v ng a negative
v impact on their plans for
f r hiring additional employees over

v r the
next six months," the report reads.
On its face, that's in line with what Obama said, but we wanted to see how Business Roundtable acquired its
results. Their report notes, "Responses were received from 134 member CEOs, 63 percent of the total
Business Roundtable membership."
Business Roundtable's membership tends to be larger companies. Spokeswoman Amanda DeBard told us
CEOs are invited based on revenue, industry and market capitalization, so it's safe to say the poll responses
don't reflect a random sample of U.S. businesses.

The low levels of PC observed during military conflicts or national security threats coincide
with low disapproval rates, suggesting that partisan warfare was not present during those
episodes. The two series follow a similar pattern, exhibiting an upward trend toward the
end of the sample, but they behave differently in periods when presidential elections are held
(displayed with circles). During those months, partisan conflict intensifies, while—as should
be expected—the disapproval ratings remain fairly stable.
