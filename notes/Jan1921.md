### Key points

   


   1. Chris  subtantially edited the second section: "what insights can epi models could offer?" by laying out different types of modeling choices in epi framework, 
      - homogenous vs heterogeneous 
      - non-structural vs structural 
      - with recovery or no recovery 
   2. Tao highlighted the addition to survey of literature that are either explicitly or implicitly epidemiological. 

### To do 

1. A write-up of the model by Shiller(1989) as a stylized example of epi expectations 
2. To subtantiate the literature review with more detailed summary of the papers listed.
