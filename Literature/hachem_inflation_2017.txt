Inflation Announcements and Social Dynamics
We propose a new framework for understanding the effectiveness of central
bank announcements when firms have heterogeneous inflation expectations.
Expectations are updated through social dynamics and, with heterogeneity,
not all firms choose to operate, putting downward pressure on realized
inflation. Our model rationalizes why countries stuck at the zero lower
bound have had a hard time increasing inflation without being aggressive.
The same model also predicts that announcing an abrupt target to disinflate
will cause inflation to undershoot the target, whereas announcing gradual
targets will not. We present new empirical evidence that corroborates this
prediction.

COMMUNICATION HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART of the monetary policy toolkit. Central banks operating in a zero lower bound environment use
communication about the future to influence expectations and stimulate the economy
(e.g., Bernanke 2004, Yellen 2013). Flexible inflation targeters have also relied on
transparent communication to anchor inflation expectations over various horizons
(e.g., Carney 2012) and transparency is now a more general trend in central banking (e.g., Woodford 2005, Blinder et al. 2008). However, heterogeneity in inflation
expectations exists despite transparency (e.g., Mankiw, Reis, and Wolfers 2004) and

prominent policymakers have called for new models of the expectation formation
process to better understand the transmission from communication to economic outcomes (e.g., King 2005, Boivin 2011, Kroszner 2011). Our paper takes a step in
this direction and proposes a new framework for understanding the effectiveness of
central bank announcements when heterogeneity is present.
We construct a model of inflation determination that is tractable and preserves
its original nonlinearities. A continua of monopolistically competitive firms make
pricing and production decisions before the aggregate price level is known, introducing a need for inflation forecasts. We consider two forecasting rules. One rule
(Random Walking) is based on last period’s inflation. The other rule (Fed Following)
is based on central bank announcements about the current period. We also allow for
heterogeneity within each rule. In other words, heterogeneity is present both within
and across rules.
We discipline our model so that each rule is individually mean rational—that is,
each rule yields unbiased forecasts of inflation when adopted by all firms. If all firms
are Fed Followers (FFs), then firm decisions should be such that the central bank’s
announcement is, in fact, realized. If all firms are Random Walkers (RWs), then firm
decisions should be such that last period’s inflation persists. Such discipline helps
rationalize why either rule could be viable in the long run. However, as we show,
the mean rational property is not trivial when there is heterogeneity within rules:
the dispersion of inflation expectations introduces pricing nonlinearities that put
upward pressure on realized inflation relative to the mean expectation. We establish
that a fixed cost of production—which generates exit among firms who expect to
be unprofitable net of this cost—offsets the pricing nonlinearities and supports two
individually mean rational rules without assuming away in-rule heterogeneity. We
then establish that this exit channel causes realized inflation to undershoot a target
announced by the central bank if there is a sufficiently interior mixture of the Fed
Following and Random Walking rules when the mean expectation reaches the target.
In contrast, if the vast majority of firms use the Fed Following rule, the mean rational
property implies convergence to the target.
The fraction of FFs is thus a crucial variable in our model. It also summarizes the
credibility of the central bank. Credibility is earned, not endowed, so we must endogenize how this happens. We use social dynamics to model the evolution of credibility.
In particular, once inflation has been realized, firms can meet and potentially switch
forecasting rules based on relative performance. A small and/or temporary divergence
of realized inflation from the central bank’s announcements may not have enough
momentum to significantly affect credibility. However, prolonged divergence may
convince many firms to abandon the central bank’s cues in favor of more successful
forecasting rules, limiting the extent to which future announcements will be realized.
Combining our model of inflation determination with social dynamics, we investigate how announcements can be tailored to limit divergence and build credibility.1
1. Notice that we are defining the central bank’s problem in terms of announcements, not conventional
policy tools such as a short-term nominal interest rate. This has precedent in Reis (2011).

We show that a period of gradual announcements helps build credibility when social
dynamics are at play. Neither this result nor the result that the central bank needs to
be highly credible to avoid undershooting its announcements depends on whether the
central bank wants to increase or decrease inflation.
In contrast, the direction that the central bank would like to move in does affect how
useful a period of aggressive announcements will be. The downward pressure from
the exit channel can make increasing inflation difficult. This result is consistent with
the observation that countries stuck at the zero lower bound since the recent financial
crisis have had a hard time increasing inflation. Our model suggests that it may be
useful to pursue an aggressive strategy, wherein the central bank sets short-run targets
above the long-run goal, before moving to a period of gradual announcements. With
high short-run targets, many FFs will set high prices because they expect high prices,
leading to higher inflation.
On the other hand, aggressive strategies do not work as well when trying to decrease
inflation. If the central bank’s target is much lower than current inflation, then FFs
will tend to exit rather than set low prices and once the majority of them have exited,
there are no gains to an even lower target. Our model thus supports gradualism during
disinflations. We present new empirical evidence that corroborates our predictions.
In particular, we establish that countries which disinflated with gradual targets rather
than abrupt targets were more successful in the sense of not undershooting their
long-run goals.
To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to (i) empirically connect undershooting with abrupt disinflation targets and (ii) show that a new model with social
dynamics rationalizes the empirics while still prescribing aggressive announcements
at the zero lower bound. In-rule heterogeneity, social dynamics, and the economic
model, all play important roles in getting these results. Without in-rule heterogeneity,
all FFs and all RWs would have the same expectation once inflation reaches the central bank’s goal. There would be no exit channel and hence no undershooting. Social
dynamics provides a natural way to simulate rule selection when performance is not
homogeneous within rules. Moreover, the benefit of developing our own economic
model rather than using a workhorse (e.g., New Keynesian) model is that we can
introduce new nonlinearities in a tractable way and see how they interact with social
dynamics. Our exit channel and its implications for undershooting are examples of
this interaction.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 1 explains the evolution of
credibility through social dynamics in our paper, Section 2 builds a model of inflation
determination and introduces the exit channel, Section 3 presents the simulation
results for increasing inflation and discusses how our framework can be extended
to think about communications surrounding major initiatives such as Quantitative
Easing, Section 4 presents the simulation results for decreasing inflation along with
new empirical evidence that links undershooting with abruptness, Section 5 discusses
the key roles played by exit and social dynamics in our results, Section 6 establishes
the robustness of our results to alternative parameterizations, and Section 7 concludes.
All proofs are collected in the Appendix.

Related Literature. Our paper is related to several literatures. First is the literature
on central bank communication. Many of the insights in this literature depend on
information asymmetries between the central bank and the public (e.g., Cukierman
and Meltzer 1986, Stein 1989, Eggertsson and Pugsley 2006, Melosi 2017) and/or
representative learning by the public to overcome such asymmetries (e.g., Orphanides
and Williams 2005, Berardi and Duffy 2007, Eusepi and Preston 2010, Branch
and Evans 2011). In contrast, our paper studies what happens when central bank
announcements are fully transparent but their credibility must be established through
social networks. In this regard, we also differ from Arifovic et al. (2010) who allow
the central bank to choose both the inflation announcement and the realized value of
inflation in a cheap talk economy with social learning.
Our paper is also more broadly related to work on heterogeneous agents and behavioral expectations. This is in contrast to workhorse models of monetary policy where
expectations are assumed to be homogeneous and rational.2 A common building
block in the behavioral literature is the use of rule-based agents.3 Applied to expectations formation, agents select from a discrete number of forecasting rules and the
popularity of each rule is determined by a heuristic. There are two main approaches to
modeling the selection heuristic in the literature. The first approach follows Brock and
Hommes (1997) in that the popularity of a given rule is performance-based and there
is no heterogeneity within each rule. Recent papers that use this approach include
Anufriev et al. (2013), Cornea, Hommes, and Massaro (2013), Hommes (2013), and
Hommes, Massaro, and Weber (2015). See also Brazier et al. (2008) and DeGrauwe
(2010) for agents who select specifically between a constant inflation target and past
inflation. The second approach is social dynamics. Agents can be heterogeneous
within rules and the popularity of a given rule is determined by genetic algorithms
(e.g., mutation and tournament selection) at the individual level. Tournaments can
be either performance-based or epidemiological and the structure of meetings can
be varied to analyze different modes of interaction. Versions of the approach appear
in Carroll (2003a), Acemoglu, Ozdaglar, and ParandehGheibi (2010), Arifovic et al.
(2010), and Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2016) among others.4 For an application of social dynamics to the New Keynesian context, see Arifovic, Bullard, and
Kostyshyna (2013).
Our paper also connects to work on heterogeneous expectations as a source of
macroeconomic persistence (e.g., Milani 2007, Fuhrer 2015a, Fuhrer 2015b). In our
framework, inflation is persistent in the sense that it does not immediately converge
to newly announced central bank targets. This is because credibility has to be established via social dynamics. The more stubborn are beliefs, the longer it will take for
credibility to accumulate and the slower convergence will be. Our framework allows

3. Ellison and Fudenberg (1993) show that even naive rules-of-thumb can achieve fairly efficient
outcomes, so rule-based agents have become a convenient way to bridge tractability and realism.

us to explore how the central bank can exploit social dynamics and build credibility
by varying announcements over time.5
Finally, some of our results are relevant to the literature on positive expectations
feedback. In Haltiwanger and Waldman (1985) and Heemeijer et al. (2009), strategic
complementarities increase the impact of irrational expectations on realized inflation and impede convergence. See also Anufriev, Hommes, and Philipse (2013) and
Pfajfar and Zakelj (2016). Our model is set up so that each forecasting rule is individually mean rational. The exit channel plays an important role in offsetting other
nonlinearities and getting the mean rational property to coexist with in-rule heterogeneity. As a result, neither rule is destabilizing or intrinsically more irrational than
the other.6

1. EXPECTATION FORMATION VIA SOCIAL DYNAMICS
Consider a continuum of agents i ∈ [0, 1]. At the beginning of date t, agent i
expects an inflation rate 
πti . This expectation is drawn from a forecasting rule and
social dynamics is the process through which agents select their rules. To illustrate
how social dynamics work, we will consider two individually mean rational rules
(i.e., the mean expectation is realized whenever all agents use the same forecasting
rule, regardless of which rule it is). In the short run, selection between competing
alternatives is the core of social dynamics so having at least two rules is important. In
the long run, selection algorithms typically converge to one alternative, so focusing
on mean rationality ensures convergence to an unbiased rule.
1.1 Forecasting Rules
Central bank announcements and random walk forecasts are natural candidates
for our two forecasting rules: Atkeson and Ohanian (2001) find that random walk
forecasts of inflation perform very well against more sophisticated statistical models,
Faust and Wright (2013) find that the Fed’s Greenbook forecasts are difficult to beat,
and Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) and Campbell et al. (2012) find that
markets do indeed view Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statements as a
source of new and reliable information about future economic conditions. While the
viability of each rule will be determined endogenously, emergence of these rules in
the real world motivates their inclusion in the option set.
Our two rules also find support in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). A
special question on the 2012Q2 survey asked respondents whether their point forecasts were consistent with the Fed’s inflation target. Forecasters who self-identified
5. This focus also clearly differs from the large literature on the extent to which macroeconomic
persistence is driven by costly price adjustment at the microeconomic level (see Caballero and Engel 2007
for a survey).

could otherwise be prone to the problems of strategic complementarities, see Hachem (2014).

as consistent were distributed around the Fed’s target. The remaining forecasters
were instead distributed around prevailing inflation, consistent with a random walk
model. The distribution of the remaining forecasters was also wider than the distribution of the Fed-consistent group, suggesting more heterogeneity within random walk
forecasts.7
To formalize our two forecasting rules, let π t denote the central bank’s date t
∗
denote realized inflation at the end of date t − 1. The
announcement and let πt−1
rules are then:
DEFINITION 1. Agent i is an FF at date t if 
πti ∼ N (π t , σ F2 ).
∗
DEFINITION 2. Agent i is an RW at date t if 
πti ∼ N (πt−1
, σ R2 )

where the standard deviations satisfy σ F < σ R and will later be parameterized to make
∗
, σ R2 )
each rule individually mean rational. In our definitions, N (π t , σ F2 ) and N (πt−1
i
are not priors. Instead, each agent i has a point forecast 
πt . The universe of FF
forecasts then looks normal with mean π t and variance σ F2 while the universe of
∗
and variance σ R2 . Notice that σ F < σ R
RW forecasts looks normal with mean πt−1
incorporates the SPF feature of lower heterogeneity among Fed-consistent forecasts.
The rationale is twofold. First, there is some pass-through from professional forecasts
to individual expectations (e.g., Carroll 2003b).8 Second, our random walking rule
is a stand-in for statistical models more generally. Agents who use such models
can disagree about which variables to include, leading to more varied forecasts. In
contrast, FFs are the set of agents who agree that the most important variable is the
central bank’s announcement.
Let ξt ∈ [0, 1] denote the fraction of FFs. If ξt = 1, then everyone adopts the FF
rule in Definition 1 and mean rationality implies πt∗ = π t . In other words, the central
bank can achieve inflation goals using only communication. We thus interpret ξt as
a measure of central bank credibility. To endogenize the evolution of ξt , we posit
that agents whose forecasts are consistently outperformed by their peers will want
to change how they forecast. Social dynamics then provides a useful approach to
modeling how an agent discovers he is being outperformed and how much of this
outperformance he attributes to one-time shocks rather than fundamentals. Initializing
ξ1 = 0, we let ξt+1 evolve via tournament selection and mutation, as described next.
1.2 Social Dynamics and the Evolution of Forecasts
Tournament selection simulates information transmission in a complex world. Our
tournaments favor agents who are endogenously more successful. This is in line with
7. Raw data are available at www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-ofprofessional-forecasters/2012/survq212.cfm
8. We emphasize the partial nature of this pass-through because firms and households do more than just
outsource their inflation expectations (e.g., Bryan, Meyer, and Parker 2014, Coibion and Gorodnichenko
2015). The existence of professional forecasts thus does not negate the need for a model of expectation
formation.

Arifovic, Bullard, and Kostyshyna (2013). Our tournaments will also permit success
to be judged over multiple observations.
To be more precise, agents meet in pairs and compare forecast errors after the realization of πt∗ . Consider a meeting between agents i and j. Agent i counts one strike
j
πti − πt∗ |.
against his forecasting rule if j used a different rule and |
πt − πt∗ | < |
∗
∗
When ξt is sufficiently high, πt will be close to π t , so |π t − πt−1 |  0 would
allow FFs to outperform RWs in many meetings. Strikes would thus tend to be
counted against the RW rule, suggesting ξt+1 ≥ ξt . In contrast, when ξt is suf∗
∗
, so |π t − πt−1
|  0 would instead allow
ficiently low, πt∗ will be close to πt−1
RWs to outperform FFs in many meetings. Strikes would thus tend to be counted
against the FF rule, suggesting ξt+1 ≤ ξt . This is the sense in which success is
endogenous.
How quickly do strikes lead to ξt+1 = ξt ? Experimental evidence suggests that
agents are very reluctant to contradict their own information, even when Bayesian
updating suggests they should (e.g., Weizsäcker 2010 and Andreoni and Mylovanov
2012). We thus allow agents to accumulate several strikes before deciding to switch
forecasting rules. This is the sense in which success is judged over multiple observations.
We use S to denote the number of strikes needed for a switch: after S strikes, agent
i switches forecasting rules and begins counting strikes against his new rule. Strikes
do not have to be consecutive to trigger a switch.
The accumulation of strikes occurs across meetings and periods, so we must also
specify how pairwise meetings come about. In our baseline specification, pairs are
drawn randomly with replacement from the entire population. Drawing with replacement means that each agent can have zero to many meetings in a given period.
Drawing from the full population ensures that even agents who do not participate in
economic activity are represented in tournaments. This is appealing since participation decisions are driven by expectations.
Going forward, we will also refer to S as stubbornness, with higher S implying
more stubborn beliefs. To gauge the importance of stubbornness and better understand
what it might represent, the robustness analysis in Section 6 will consider different
values of S along with different specifications for how firms meet and accumulate
strikes. As we will see, higher values of S can be interpreted as a stand-in for more
localized interactions.9
Finally, to capture the fact that some changes may not be performance-driven, we
incorporate mutations: at the beginning of date t + 1, a very small fraction θ ∈ (0, 1)
of agents randomly switches rules regardless of strikes.
The timing of our social forces can now be summarized as follows: (i) mutation turns the fraction of FFs into 
ξt = (1 − θ )ξt + θ (1 − ξt ) if t ≥ 2; (ii) each
agent i draws expectation 
πti from his forecasting rule; (iii) the set of expectations
9. Regardless of whether our meetings are random or local, the probability that any one agent connects
with any other agent (possibly through multiple links) is positive. The assumptions in Acemoglu, Ozdaglar,
and ParandehGheibi (2010) for a strongly connected graph are therefore satisfied.

2. AN EXPECTATIONS-BASED MODEL OF INFLATION
We now present a formal model to map inflation expectations into realized inflation.
Interpret the continuum of agents in Section 1 as a continuum of firms, each producing
a different perishable good i ∈ [0, 1]. The demand for good i at date t is of the form
1
Dit = (γt pPitt ) 1−ρ , where pit is the price charged by firm i, Pt is an aggregate price
level, γt ∈ [1 − ε, 1 + ε] is an exogenous and independently distributed aggregate
taste shock, and ρ ∈ (0, 1) is a constant.
The demand for good i is decreasing in the relative price pPitt rather than just the
absolute price pit . This creates a role for inflation expectations. In particular, firms
have to make pricing and production decisions before Pt and γt are realized—that is,
before they know the actual demand for their products. At the beginning of date t,
∗
∗
ti ≡ exp(
πti )Pt−1
, where Pt−1
is last
each firm i forecasts an aggregate price level of P
i
period’s realized price level and 
πt is the firm’s inflation expectation for the current
period. Firm i will ultimately draw 
πti from one of the two forecasting rules described
in Section 1, but, for now, we can imagine a generic set of inflation expectations. To
simplify the exposition and remain focused on inflation expectations, assume that all
firms also forecast a taste shock of one. In other words, the forecasting rule for γt is
simply the mean of the shock.10
The supply of good i is given by the production function F( it ) = itα , where
α ∈ (0, 1) is a constant and it is the labor input used by firm i. The aggregate stock
of labor is normalized to 1 and inelastically available at unit wage wt . In order to
produce at date t, firm i must also pay a fixed cost. The fixed cost has a constant real
value U > 0, which is paid in nominal terms (Pt∗ U ) at the end of the period. A firm
is said to operate at date t if and only if it expects profit net of the nominal fixed cost
to be positive. When expectations are heterogeneous, the fixed cost gives rise to an
exit channel that, as we will see later, plays an important role in our paper.

Notice that operating firms with higher price expectations charge higher prices. They

Flow of funds. There is a household in the background who supplies workers and
buys goods. Workers remit their wages to the household. Fixed costs and profits of
operating firms are also remitted to the household. The household’s total income thus
equals its total expenditure on goods.
Discussion. We now elaborate on some of the modeling elements used above, namely,
the role of γt and the choice of α < 1. As per Woodford (2013), “it is appealing
to assume that people’s beliefs should be rational, in the ordinary-language sense,
though there is a large step from this to the RE hypothesis.” The principle of ordinarylanguage rationality motivates the timing of our taste shock. Without γt in equation
(5), the auctioneer could compute Pt∗ at the same time as wt∗ . While our firms deviate
ti based on wt∗ , they would also be deviating
from the RE hypothesis by not updating P
ti based on
from rationality in the ordinary-language sense if they did not update P
∗
Pt . The choice of α < 1 is similarly motivated. Notice from equation (1) that α = 1
prompts all firms to set the same price, namely, a constant markup over the wage,
regardless of expectations. On the one hand, this isolates the effect of expectations
on realized inflation through just the labor market. On the other hand, it eliminates
the lag between wt∗ and Pt∗ in the auctioneer’s problem. We can thus use α = 1 to
build some intuition but our full model will employ α < 1. With α < 1, prices are not
simple markups, so γt enters equation (5) and the lag between wt∗ and Pt∗ is restored.
Importantly, this restoration stems from production being nonlinear in labor, not from
production being decreasing returns to scale.12
11. As equations (4) and (5) show, our model is one where actual inflation is determined entirely by
expected inflation. In other words, the central bank can only change inflation by changing expectations.
While our abstraction from conventional policy tools is done to isolate the effect of communication, work
by Campbell (2013) demonstrates that it may, in fact, be optimal for policymakers to rely on open mouth
operations, even when open market operations are available.
12. In a previous version, we showed that the key properties of our model hold when production is
zλ
instead given by F( it , z it ) = itα z it1−α , where z it is firm effort and the real disutility of such effort is λit with
α
λ ∈ (1, ∞]. Notice that F( it ) = it is just the limiting case of λ → ∞.

2.2 Results with One Forecasting Rule
Before combining the model of Subsection 2.1 with the two forecasting rules in
Section 1, it is instructive to establish how the model works with one forecasting rule
since that covers the two limits: 100% Random Walking and 100% Fed Following.
PROPOSITION 1. If 
πti ∼ N (μ, σ 2 ) for all i, then πt∗ = μ + f (σ ; ), where is the
set of all parameters excluding μ and σ . To conserve on notation, f (σ ) ≡ f (σ ; )
henceforth.
Proposition 1 says that excess inflation, πt∗ − μ, does not depend on the mean expectation μ. It does, however, depend on the extent of expectations heterogeneity σ ,
which is a dependence we want to emphasize. In particular, our model is sufficiently
nonlinear that realized inflation may not equal the mean expectation when expectations are heterogeneous. Naturally though, realized inflation should line up with the
mean expectation in the long run: if everyone draws inflation forecasts from N (μ, σ 2 )
but realized inflation ends up being πt∗ = μ, then N (μ, σ 2 ) is a biased forecasting
rule and its survival into the long run would seem at odds with ordinary-language rationality. We therefore seek parameter conditions under which heterogeneity (σ > 0)
and mean rationality (πt∗ = μ) coexist. The rest of this subsection will build up to
these parameter conditions. Unless otherwise specified, all lemmas and propositions
assume 
πti ∼ N (μ, σ 2 ) for all i as in Proposition 1.
To fix ideas, start with the limiting case of α = 1. As per Subsection 2.1, prices
will be a constant markup over the wage, so realized inflation will be determined in
the labor market. We can thus focus on equation (4). Absent a fixed cost, all firms
will operate so Ot (wt ) = [0, 1] for any wt . In other words, the operating set will be
independent of the wage. The following lemma reveals that realized inflation will
exceed the mean expectation:
LEMMA 1. If α = 1 and U = 0, then f (σ ) =

σ2
.
2(1−ρ)

σ
The excess inflation in Lemma 1, 2(1−ρ)
, is a Jensen’s inequality term that arises
because normal inflation expectations are compounded into log-normal price expectations and aggregated. The Jensen’s term is exacerbated by more heterogeneity in
inflation expectations (i.e., higher σ ) and more substitutability between goods (i.e.,
higher ρ). As σ increases, the compounding process skews the distribution of price
expectations further right. The highest expectation firms thus drive wages up more
than the lowest expectation firms drive them down. The effect is strongest when
goods are more substitutable because high expectation firms foresee a huge increase
in sales by undercutting the aggregate price level and thus participate more actively
in the labor market.
Eliminating excess inflation without eliminating heterogeneity requires overcoming the Jensen’s inequality term. Intuitively, this requires giving low expectation firms
more pull to overcome the pull that compounding gives high expectation firms. Allowing low expectation firms to not produce by introducing a fixed cost is one way to

achieve this, motivating our use of U > 0.13 With fixed costs, Ot (wt ) ⊂ [0, 1] and,
as shown next, |Ot (wt )| decreases when expectations become more heterogeneous:
LEMMA 2. If α ≤ 1 and U > 0, then the fraction of firms that operate is decreasing
in σ .
The intuition for Lemma 2 is as follows. Higher σ amplifies the disproportionate
effect that high expectation firms have on wage determination. Since a higher wage
cuts into expected profit, the presence of a positive fixed cost means more firms will
choose not to operate.
What we have just described is an exit channel which will put downward pressure
on the wage and thus potentially offset the Jensen’s inequality term. Can the offset
be complete in the sense of restoring mean rationality (πt∗ = μ) without eliminating
heterogeneity (σ > 0)? We first saw the Jensen’s term in Lemma 1, so let us start
with that context:
LEMMA 3. If α = 1 and U ≥ 1 − ρ, then f (σ0 ) = 0 for a unique σ0 > 0. Moreover,
f  (σ0 ) > 0.
In words, Lemma 3 says that a sufficiently high fixed cost introduces a point of
mean rationality—that is, a point σ0 > 0 with no excess inflation—when α = 1. The
solid gray line in Figure 1(a) provides a graphical representation of this result.14
13. In principle, one could instead assume normality (rather than log-normality) of price expectations.
In practice though, prices cannot be negative, so the appropriate assumption would be truncated normality,
which, like log-normality, is not symmetric.
14. The ability of exit to counter Jensen’s inequality does not hinge on inflation expectations being
single draws from a normal distribution: if each firm were to draw a full prior as its forecast, the proof of
Lemma 3 shows that exit can be restored with two different forecasts and appropriate bounds on U .

We will now show that the model with α < 1 can have two points of mean rationality. We want the main results to be derived under α < 1 for the reasons discussed
at the end of Subsection 2.1. We also want two points of mean rationality so that the
Fed Following and Random Walking rules in Definitions 1 and 2 are not restricted
to having the same standard deviation. Proposition 2 below identifies parameter conditions under which our model has two mean rational points. We will denote these
points as σ F and σ R and use them later as the standard deviations in Definitions 1 and
2, respectively. Proposition 2 also establishes a region of negative excess inflation in
between these two points.
PROPOSITION 2. There exist values α ∈ (0, 1) and U > U > 0 such that α ∈ (α, 1)
and U ∈ (U , U ) yield f (σ F ) = f (σ R ) = 0 for σ R > σ F > 0. Moreover, f  (σ F ) < 0
and f  (σ R ) > 0, so f (σ ) < 0 for σ ∈ ⊆ (σ F , σ R ), where is a nonempty set.
The parameter conditions identified in Proposition 2 are qualitative in nature, so
the blue area in Figure 1(b) provides a numerical example when ρ = 0.9. For any
combination of α and U in this blue area, our model has two mean rational points
with a region of negative excess inflation in between. It also turns out that the region
of negative excess inflation is the entire region between the two mean rational points.
The blue line in Figure 1(a) provides a graphical representation.
To understand why excess inflation is negative between the two mean rational
points, recall the competing effects of higher σ on wages in equation (4). As σ
increases, the compounding of inflation expectations into price expectations skews the
distribution of price expectations right and puts upward pressure on the wage through
the labor demands of high expectation firms. As the wage increases though, low
expectation firms find production unprofitable and the resulting decline in operation
puts downward pressure on the wage. For lower values of σ , the exit of low expectation
firms dominates and dampens the wage but, when σ becomes sufficiently large, the
labor demands of high expectation firms take over. The dependence of wt∗ on σ is thus
U-shaped. We know from equation (1) that individual prices respond positively to
wages so, all else constant, the shape of wt∗ feeds into Pt∗ . Notice, however, that α < 1
implies additional upward pressure on Pt∗ at the price aggregation stage. Since only
firms with sufficiently high expectations produce, the individual prices aggregated
ti ) with P
ti high. Therefore, the pass-through from wt∗ to
by equation (5) are p(wt∗ ; P
∗
Pt varies across σ but, for α ∈ (α, 1) and U ∈ (U , U ), it is enough to generate two
mean rational points with a U-shaped pattern in between. If the fixed cost is too high
(i.e., U > U ) or the returns to labor are too low (i.e., α < α), then exit is too strong
relative to labor demand and we get only one mean rational point. If the fixed cost is
too low (i.e., U < U ), then exit is weak and we get no mean rational points.
2.3 Two Forecasting Rules with Common Means
We now move to an environment with two forecasting rules. Consider the two rules

given in Definitions 1 and 2 but with π t = πt−1

works under this restriction will help us understand what happens when inflation

FIG. 2. Two Forecasting Rules with Common Mean.
NOTES: The left panel illustrates combinations of α < 1 and U > 0 that (i) produce two mean rational points σ F > 0 and
σ R > 0 and (ii) generate negative excess inflation when expectations are a mixture of N (μ, σ F2 ) and N (μ, σ R2 ). The right
panel plots excess inflation as a function of the fraction of expectations drawn from N (μ, σ F2 ). The parameters used to
plot the right panel come from the shaded area in the left panel.

approaches the central bank’s target in our simulation results. The simulations in
∗
to see how inflation can be made to
Sections 3 and 4 will then allow for π t = πt−1
approach the target in the first place.
PROPOSITION 3. Suppose 
πti ∼ N (μ, σ F2 ) for a group of size ξt and 
πti ∼ N (μ, σ R2 )
∗
for the rest, where f (σ F ) = f (σ R ) = 0. If α = 1, then πt = μ for all ξt ∈ (0, 1).
Under α = 1, Proposition 3 says that the entire population is mean rational when
each subpopulation is individually mean rational. We know from equation (1) that
all firms set the same price when α = 1, so any heterogeneity in expectations only
affects the economy through labor market clearing, namely, equation (4). The latter
aggregates linearly across subpopulations, so if the component distributions are each
parameterized to deliver πt∗ = μ, then their mixture will also deliver πt∗ = μ.
Now consider the more interesting case of α < 1, which introduces heterogeneity
into the price aggregation of equation (5). Recall that any combination of α and U
from the blue area in Figure 1(b) produces two mean rational distributions when
ρ = 0.9. Call this the feasible parameter space for ρ = 0.9. The blue area in Figure
2(a) plots the feasible parameters for which any mixture of the two mean rational
distributions produces negative excess inflation. To provide a concrete example of
what this means, Figure 2(b) plots excess inflation, yt ≡ πt∗ − μ, as a function of the
degree of mixing, ξt , for one combination of α and U drawn from the blue area in
Figure 2(a). Any other combination will deliver the same general shape. Note that we
are using yt to denote excess inflation when there are two forecasting rules rather than
f (·), which denoted excess inflation when there was only one forecasting rule. We
verify that the blue area in Figure 2(a) overlaps the entire feasible space in Figure 1(b),
so combinations of α and U that generate two distinct mean rational distributions

KINDA HACHEM AND JING CYNTHIA WU

:

1687

also generate negative excess inflation for any mixture of these distributions when
ρ = 0.9. Similar results are verified for ρ = 0.85 and ρ = 0.95.
Notice that the shape of yt over ξt ∈ [0, 1] in Figure 2(b) resembles the shape
of f (·) over σ ∈ [σ F , σ R ]. This is useful as it permits interpretation of our results
vis-à-vis Figure 1(a): if one uses N (μ, σx2 ) with some σx ∈ (σ F , σ R ) to approximate
∗
= μ, then πt∗ < μ
the aggregate distribution generated by ξt ∈ (0, 1) and π t = πt−1
follows for the reasons discussed in Subsection 2.2.
Before proceeding, let us comment on how the feasible parameter space changes
with ρ. As mentioned above, for each value of ρ listed in Figure 2(a), the shaded
area exactly overlaps the feasible region for that ρ. Notice that the shaded area shifts
up as ρ decreases. In other words, the feasible region involves higher values of U
as ρ decreases. Lower ρ means goods are less substitutable, so the demand for good
i falls by less when the price of good i rises. Firms can achieve higher profits in
this environment, so a higher fixed cost is needed to create the exit channel. Also,
notice that lower values of ρ admit a larger feasible region. With less substitutability
between goods, firms are less responsive to each other and this helps generate similar
equilibrium properties across a wider range of parameter choices.

3. ANNOUNCEMENTS TO INCREASE INFLATION
We now combine the economic model in Section 2 with the social dynamics in
Section 1 to study how central bank announcements can be used to increase inflation.
Our model abstracts from conventional policy tools such as short-term interest rates,
isolating the effect of communication and mimicking the situation faced by a central
bank at the zero lower bound. We first consider announcements about the level of
inflation. We then consider announcements about major initiatives (e.g., quantitative
easing) that have the potential to skew the entire distribution of inflation expectations.

3.1 Inflation Targets
Recall that announcements affect the forecasting rule in Definition 1 but this rule
only matters for inflation if used by enough firms. The economic model of Section
2 allows us to calculate πt∗ conditional on ξt and the forecasting rules. Using social
dynamics as per Section 1, we can then determine ξt+1 conditional on πt∗ , ξt , and the
forecasting rules.
Suppose inflation starts at π0 = −2%. A less extreme starting point (e.g., π0 = 1%)
would not change the nature of the results and, if anything, would be easier to overπ1i ∼ N (−2%, σ R2 ).
come. With ξ1 = 0, all firms are RWs who forecast according to 
∗
The mean rational property thus yields π1 = −2%. Now suppose the central bank
tries to increase inflation by announcing π t = 2% for all t ≥ 1. This announcement
introduces a new forecasting rule, Fed Following, which a small fraction of firms
mutate toward. We set the mutation parameter to θ = 0.02, which is conservative

1688

:

MONEY, CREDIT AND BANKING

compared to the social dynamics literature.15 This ensures that Fed Following will
only become popular if it performs well in tournaments.
In our baseline social dynamics, randomly matched firms compare forecasting
performance and switch rules after being outperformed eight times (S = 8). We
use N = 1, 000 firms and randomly draw N pairs with replacement each period
to simulate the meetings. Alternative specifications—for example, different strike
accumulation rules, different values of θ and S, and more/less meetings per period—
are discussed in Section 6. The model parameters are set to ρ = 0.9, α = 0.9, and
U = 0.18. The choice of ρ captures high but imperfect substitutability between
goods. The choices of α and U come from the blue region in Figure 1(b) so that
we have two individually mean rational subpopulations. Any parameter combination from this region will deliver qualitatively similar results.16 Finally, we assume that the taste shock is uniformly distributed according to γt ∼ U[0.99, 1.01].
These parameter choices deliver σ F = 0.0036 and σ R = 0.0643 as the solutions to
f (·) = 0.
Figure 3(a) summarizes the results. Notice that inflation converges to 2%, albeit
slowly. Slow convergence reflects two competing forces. Recall from Subsection 2.1
that firms with higher price expectations demand more labor and set higher prices.
FFs start as the high expectation firms, so their initial impact is to increase inflation
via wage and price-setting. However, also recall from Subsection 2.1 that firms with
low expectations (relative to their peers) are less likely to operate. RWs start as the
low expectation firms, so their initial impact is to decrease inflation by not fully
participating in the labor market.
If the upward pressure from FF price-setting outweighs the downward pressure
from RW exit, then the central bank may want to make even more aggressive announcements. The path we consider is one where the central bank announces shortterm targets above its long-run goal of 2%. The idea that there could be differences
between short-run announcements and long-run goals is not unprecedented. For example, as part of the “Evans Rule” adopted between December 2012 and March 2014,
the Federal Reserve was willing to tolerate 1- to 2-year ahead inflation of up to 2.5%
despite a 2% long-run target. The aggressive announcements we have in mind take
this a step further and target, rather than simply tolerate, higher short-term inflation.
As shown in Figure 3(b), aggressive short-term targets, 3% in this numerical
example, induce any FFs to set very high prices, boosting inflation. At the same time
though, the big gap between realized and targeted inflation early on does nothing to
help the central bank accumulate more FFs. Therefore, dropping the target to 2%
right when 2% is reached will lead to less than 2% inflation in subsequent periods.
This is an application of Subsection 2.3: when the FF and RW rules are centered
around similar points, having a mix of FFs and RWs will lead to inflation below the
common means. Basically, the mixture of rules involves an amount of dispersion that
leads the exit channel to dominate. We will refer to the “inflation below the common
15. Arifovic, Bullard, and Kostyshyna (2013), for example, use a mutation parameter of 0.1.
16. Recall from Subsection 2.3 that the blue regions in Figures 1(b) and 2(a) coincide.

means” phenomenon as undershooting of the central bank’s long-run target when the
common means equal this target. Recall that the FF and RW rules are individually
mean rational, so, if the vast majority of firms used the same rule, the exit channel
would not dominate the pricing nonlinearities in our model and inflation would not
undershoot. It would thus help the central bank to have ξt close to 1 when the 2%
announcement takes hold. Figure 3(c) shows that gradually lowering the aggressive
target toward 2% gives FFs more chances to succeed in tournaments and achieves the
desired result.

3.2 Additional Antideflation Announcements
In Subsection 3.1, the direct effect of central bank announcements was limited to
the mean of the FF distribution. We now consider more potent announcements that can
directly affect the skewness of the economy-wide distribution. A practical example
is what Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) dub the inflation channel of
Quantitative Easing (QE): curbing deflationary expectations through the Fed’s widely
publicized large-scale asset purchases.17
We introduce this channel into our model via redraws. More precisely, some
firms with deflationary expectations redraw their expectations (
πti ) after hearing
that the central bank will take a proactive approach to stimulating the economy.
We will refer to the announcements that convey this proactive approach as antideflation announcements. Each redraw comes from the same distribution as the
original draw, so not all deflationary expectations will be eliminated. However, redraws do have the effect of skewing the RW and FF distributions so that more
mass exists in the positive region compared to the original normal distribution.
Since very few FFs actually expect deflation, the skew is stronger for RWs but,
either way, the effect of antideflation announcements is to increase expectations,
reduce dispersion, enlarge the set of operating firms, and put upward pressure on
inflation.
We consider two dimensions of antideflation announcements: rounds and intensity.
In our context, rounds means the number of periods with media coverage about an
antideflation policy like QE, and therefore, the number of periods that have redraws.
Intensity means the fraction of deflationary firms that are exposed to this coverage,
and therefore, the fraction that redraw in a given period. The central bank again faces
π0 = −2% but now it would like to return to 2% without using short-term targets
that differ from its long-run goal. Figure 4 illustrates how this can be achieved by
varying rounds and intensity.
Figures 4(a) and 4(b) fix intensity at 1, meaning that all firms with deflationary
expectations redraw. Figure 4(a) shows that one round of antideflation announcements
helps increase inflation but more time is needed to reach 2%. Figure 4(b) shows that
17. Much of the existing QE literature abstracts from the inflation channel and focuses on yield curves
(e.g., Gagnon et al. 2011, Williams 2011, Hamilton and Wu 2012, D’Amico and King 2013, Wu and Xia
2016, Wu and Zhang 2016, etc.).

two rounds of antideflation announcements push the economy above 2% for a short
time before inflation dips back below 2% for several periods.
Figure 4(c) then demonstrates that two rounds with less than full intensity can
bring the economy to 2% quickly and without any time above target. However, once
the rounds run out, the economy again dips back below 2% for several periods.
Just as redraws skew the distributions and increase operation, the end of redraws
unskews the distributions and decreases operation. Therefore, if there is a sufficiently
interior mix of FFs and RWs when the redraws stop, exit among RWs returns the
undershooting problem of Figure 3(b). This is the same problem we are seeing in
Figures 4(b) and 4(c).
Figure 4(d) illustrates the outcome of many rounds and low intensity. Notice
that increasing the number of rounds makes it possible to find an intensity that
returns inflation to 2% monotonically. With more rounds, the central bank has more
time to accumulate FFs before antideflation announcements stop. This will help
eliminate the undershooting problem discussed above. At the same time, more rounds
must be combined with a sufficiently low intensity to avoid exceeding 2% as in
Figure 4(b).
4. DISINFLATION AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
The discussion so far has focused on increasing inflation. Regardless of whether the
central bank uses short-term inflation targets or announcements about antideflation
policies like QE, we showed that the ultimate goal will be undershot when there is
a clear mix of FFs and RWs. This is triggered by the “inflation below the common
means” phenomenon mentioned earlier and reflects the existence of an exit channel.
We also showed that announcements can be designed to help FFs accumulate through
tournament selection. In other words, undershooting is avoided when central bank
announcements are such that inflation approaches the target with a high fraction of
FFs. The aftermath of the recent global financial crisis has not yet produced enough
observations to allow testing this idea in a low inflation climate. However, as we
will now describe, a similar idea is relevant for decreasing inflation. This is useful
because a number of countries have gone through disinflations with the use of targets.
We can exploit cross-country differences in how these targets were introduced to test
our model.
4.1 Disinflation in the Model
Suppose initial inflation is high. We consider two scenarios that are guided
by the data that will be presented in Subsection 4.2. In the first (abrupt) scenario, initial inflation is π0 = 8% and the central bank announces π t = 4% for
all t ≥ 1. In the second (gradual) scenario, initial inflation is π0 = 15% and
the central bank announces a downward path that interpolates between 15%
and a long-run target of 4%. Figure 5 shows how realized inflation in the
model differs across the two scenarios. The critical difference between these two

scenarios is the degree of abruptness, not the level of initial inflation. The same
qualitative results obtain if initial inflation is assumed to be the same in the two
scenarios.
Notice from Figure 5 that the central bank can convert more firms into FFs by
achieving interim targets along the gradual path. This leads to most firms forecasting according to 
πti ∼ N (2%, σ F2 ) when 2% is reached, preventing undershooting
because of the mean rational property. In contrast, the abrupt scenario involves large
gaps between realized and announced inflation early on. These gaps impede the accumulation of FFs via tournament selection. It is only once realized inflation is in
the vicinity of the 2% target that FFs begin to accumulate more quickly. However,
with stubborn beliefs, this accumulation is not quick enough to avoid having a clear
mix of RWs and FFs when 2% is reached, opening the door for undershooting. Our

model thus predicts that undershooting is more likely when the central bank tries to
disinflate by abruptly introducing low inflation targets.18
4.2 Disinflation in the Data
As just described, a testable implication of our model is that abrupt targets during
a disinflation lead to temporary undershooting, while gradual targets do not. We now
demonstrate that this prediction is borne out in the data.
We start with the set of 29 inflation targeters in Roger (2009) and Svensson
(2011). The sample for each country starts in the quarter in which it formally adopted
inflation targets and ends in 2013Q3. The earliest observation is thus New Zealand
in 1990Q1. We collect data on the path of inflation targets from individual central
bank websites. Our data on actual inflation then come from the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics database, as per Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007). The number
of countries that begin with above-target inflation is much greater than the number
that begin with below-target inflation, so we focus on the former. Excluding countries
that eventually abandoned inflation targeting, we are left with 19 countries. These
countries are listed in the first column of Table 1. The rest of the table provides
qualitative indicators of abruptness and undershooting for each country using the
metrics described next.
18. To be sure, conventional policy tools (e.g., short-term nominal interest rates) can be used together
with announcements in a disinflation. Our abstraction from conventional tools allows us to isolate the
effect of the announcements.

We first construct some intuitive dummies for abruptness in a given country. The
first, abrupt1, equals 1 if the targeted path is flat. This is the least subjective measure
of abruptness, so we adopt it as the benchmark. The second dummy, abrupt2, equals
1 if the absolute value of the net change in inflation targets between the time of
introduction and the end of our sample is less than 40% of the absolute value of
the net change in realized inflation over the same period. The third dummy, abrupt3,
equals 1 if the standard error of the inflation targets that make up the targeted path is
smaller than the final target. The left panel in Table 1 shows the division of countries
between abrupt and gradual according to each measure. By definition, any country
with abrupt1 = 1 will also have abrupt2 = and abrupt3 = 1.
To help visualize the data, Figure 6 compares the average inflation rates and targeted
paths for abrupt versus gradual targeters. The top panel averages over countries with
abrupt1 = 1, while the bottom panel averages over countries with abrupt1 = 0.
Averages are for each point in time, with time 0 denoting the introduction of inflation
targets. For both abrupt and gradual targeters, the average long-run inflation target is
around 4%. Notice from Figure 6 that undershooting is more characteristic of abrupt
inflation targeters, consistent with the model predictions in Figure 5.
For more formal empirical evidence on abruptness and undershooting, we construct some undershooting dummies and then run simple qualitative cross-country
regressions. The benefit of this approach is that it is model-free and scale-free: the
results are less susceptible to outliers and thus more robust for small samples. To
construct a dummy variable for undershooting, let t1 denote the first quarter in which
actual inflation hits the targeted path from above and let t2 , where t2 > t1 , denote
the first quarter in which actual inflation hits the final target from below.19 Our main
dependent variable, under1, is a dummy that equals 1 if average inflation is less than
the average target over the period t1 to t2 . As an alternative, we also define under2,
which equals 1 if average inflation is less than the average target for the period t1 to
2013Q3. The right panel in Table 1 shows the division of countries according to each
undershooting measure.
The first two panels in Table 2 report the results of our qualitative regressions. The
first three columns in the left panel regress under1 on abrupt1, abrupt2, and abrupt3,
respectively. The middle panel repeats the exercise using under2 as the dependent
variable. The intercepts in our regressions are generally small and statistically insignificant, whereas the abruptness coefficients are generally large and significant.
On the whole, the range of intercepts suggests that the probability of undershooting
is 0–29% for gradual targeters, while the range of intercepts plus slopes suggests that
this probability is 46–100% for abrupt targeters. The difference is economically and
statistically significant.
To check the robustness of our empirical results, we also run regressions that
control for the distance between initial and desired inflation (d2target). Comparing
19. If actual inflation never hit the final target from below, we set t2 equal to the last quarter in our
sample (i.e., 2013Q3). If actual inflation also never hits the targeted path from above, we set t1 equal to
the first quarter in which the final target became effective.

All variables are as defined in Subsection 4.2.

the first and fourth columns in each panel of Table 2 reveals that the abruptness
coefficient is largely unchanged, both quantitatively and qualitatively. In contrast, the
coefficient on d2target is always small and insignificant. Therefore, even controlling
for initial conditions, there is evidence that undershooting is more characteristic of
abrupt targeters.
As a complement to the qualitative results, the last panel in Table 2 presents
some quantitative cross-country regressions. Our dependent variable, under_num,
is defined as the average difference between actual and targeted inflation over the
period t1 to t2 . Notice that under1 = 1 if and only if under_num < 0, so undershooting
will now be indicated by negative regression coefficients. The intercepts in the first
three columns of this last panel measure the average undershooting among gradual
targeters, whereas the sum of the intercepts and abruptness coefficients measures
the average undershooting among abrupt targeters. The intercepts are positive but
generally insignificant, whereas the abruptness coefficients are negative and generally
significant. Classifying abruptness according to abrupt1, the first column says that
actual inflation will average 0.97 percentage points below an abrupt target. The last
column then says this result is robust to initial condition controls. The quantitative
results thus align with the qualitative ones.

5. DISCUSSION OF KEY CHANNELS
There are two recurring themes in our results: the possibility of temporarily undershooting the central bank’s inflation target and the ultimate convergence of inflation
to this target. The exit channel introduced in Section 2 provides the economic mechanism for undershooting. In what follows, we elaborate on the asymmetries implied
by the exit channel and the relation of these asymmetries to our undershooting

1698

results. We also comment on the role of social dynamics in limiting undershooting to
a temporary phenomenon and generating convergence.
5.1 Exit and Asymmetry
Undershooting can occur regardless of whether inflation hits the central bank’s
target from above or below. See Figures 3(b), 4(b), 4(c), and 5(a). Also, notice that
we did not obtain any results where inflation overshoots a constant target, except in the
case of antideflation announcements, which involved extra tools. The dynamics of our
model are therefore asymmetric. The intuition goes back to our discussion of Figures
1 and 2. Parameters that support two individually mean rational forecasting rules also
generate negative excess inflation (relative to a common mean) when expectations are
a mixture of these two rules. This is because the exit channel dominates the Jensen’s
inequality term for such mixtures.
The downward pressure imparted by exit can also apply if the mixture involves
different means. Consider, for example, Figures 3(a) and 5(a). The central bank is
using constant targets to change inflation by 4 percentage points, with Figure 3(a)
illustrating a 4 percentage point increase and Figure 5(a) illustrating a 4 percentage
point decrease. In both cases, realized inflation falls below the mean expectation
once there is a clear mix of forecasting rules. This is another instance of negative
excess inflation but without the restriction of common means. There is an important
implication here for how sluggish (if at all) the inflation adjustment will be. In
particular, notice that it takes longer for inflation to rise by 4 percentage points in
Figure 3(a) than it does for inflation to fall by 4 percentage points in Figure 5(a).20
If realized inflation equaled the mean expectation along the entire transition path,
then the time to target would be the same regardless of whether the central bank was
trying to increase or decrease inflation. The exit channel, by creating negative excess
inflation during the transition, accelerates what the central bank is trying to achieve
in Figure 5(a) but makes it more sluggish in Figure 3(a).
The above discussion suggests that, with constant targets, increasing inflation is
harder than decreasing inflation. The opposite is true with aggressive targets and
the reason is again the exit channel. To be more precise, recall that the central
bank in Subsection 3.1 increased inflation by announcing a short-term target above
its long-run goal (an aggressive strategy), whereas the central bank in Subsection
4.1 decreased inflation using a gradual path. Why not decrease inflation by simply
announcing a short-term target below the long-run goal? The logic stems from an
asymmetry in how FFs help the central bank achieve its goals. When the central
bank announces a high target to increase inflation, FFs help by setting high prices.
When the central bank announces a low target to decrease inflation, FFs help either
by setting low prices or by exiting. Recall that exit puts downward pressure on prices
via the market-clearing wage. If the attempted disinflation is sufficiently large and
20. What matters is the direction of the 4 percentage point change, not the starting point. Similar
results would be obtained if Figure 5(a) went from 2% to −2% instead of 8% to 4%. We have omitted this
figure for brevity.

KINDA HACHEM AND JING CYNTHIA WU

:

1699

abrupt, then FFs will tend to exit, and once the majority of them have exited, they
are unavailable to help any further. There would be no gains to setting an even
lower target in this case.21 Therefore, the exit channel implies that the gains to being
aggressive deteriorate faster when trying to decrease inflation than when trying to
increase it.
The asymmetries generated by the exit channel help reconcile two seemingly contradictory observations about the real world. On the one hand, the new empirical
evidence in Subsection 4.2 established that countries that disinflated with gradual
targets rather than abrupt targets were more successful in the sense of not undershooting their long-run goals. On the other hand, countries stuck at the zero lower
bound since the recent financial crisis have only mustered sluggish increases in inflation, arguably because they have not been aggressive enough. The exit channel in
our paper helps reconcile these two observations. More precisely, our exit channel
(i) opens the door for negative excess inflation when expectations are a mixture and
(ii) implies asymmetric gains to being aggressive when trying to increase rather than
decrease inflation. These asymmetric gains do not negate the fact that a period of
gradual targets helps build credibility regardless of whether the central bank wants to
push inflation up or down. However, they do make a case for preceding gradualism
with aggressive announcements when trying to increase inflation.

5.2 The Role of Social Dynamics
Our paper has used social dynamics to endogenize the mix of FFs and RWs. To
better appreciate the contribution of social dynamics to our results, we now consider
what happens if the mix of FFs and RWs is set according to some simple benchmarks.
Figure 7(a) shows what happens if we fix ξt = ξ for all t, where ξ ∈
{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}. Initial inflation and the targeted path are both as in Figure
5(a). The black line labeled “baseline” in Figure 7(a) replicates the blue line labeled
“realized” in Figure 5(a). The colored lines in Figure 7(a) then show the results for
the different values of ξ . If ξ = 0, then no one uses central bank announcements
as a basis for forecasting. Inflation stays at its initial level and announcements are
never effective. If ξ = 1, then everyone uses the central bank’s announcements and
inflation immediately falls to the long-run target. If ξ ∈ {0.25, 0.5, 0.75}, then the
mix of FFs and RWs is sufficiently interior that inflation settles noticeably below the
target: with a constant mix, ξt is independent of how well different rules perform, so
there is no mechanism (e.g., tournament selection) to accumulate FFs and eliminate
undershooting once it happens.
The role of tournaments is also evidenced in Figure 7(b) which shows what happens
if social dynamics involve only mutation. The black line labeled “baseline” again
replicates the blue line labeled “realized” in Figure 5(a). Recall that the baseline
specification starts at ξ1 = 0, then lets ξt+1 evolve via mutation and tournament
21. If anything, an even lower target would be bad for credibility-building because it would just widen
the gap between realized and targeted inflations.

ξt+1 = (1 − θ )ξt + θ (1 − ξt ) for all t, so the fraction of FFs converges smoothly to
0.5.
Notice from the right panel of Figure 7(b) that, for the first 15 or so periods,
the fraction of FFs in the baseline is very similar to the fraction of FFs in the
mutation-only specification with ξ1 = 0. When an abrupt target is first introduced,

KINDA HACHEM AND JING CYNTHIA WU

1701

FF forecasts tend to be outperformed by RWs, so FFs do not accumulate, even when
tournaments exist. Around the target, however, the tables turn and many RW forecasts
are outperformed by FFs. Tournaments will now accelerate the accumulation of FFs,
which, given mean rationality of our forecasting rules, eliminates undershooting. In
contrast, all of the mutation-only specifications settle well below the target because, as
in the fixed proportions case, there is no mechanism to accumulate FFs and eliminate
undershooting once it happens.
Tournaments thus play an important role in generating convergence to the long-run
target. For similar reasons, tournaments also play an important role in explaining why
gradual targets can achieve convergence without any undershooting. In Figure 5(b),
for example, the achievement of interim targets along the gradual path allowed tournaments to accelerate the accumulation of FFs before the long-run target was reached.
Introducing a gradual path into the fixed proportions or mutation-only specifications
would not eliminate undershooting or achieve convergence because FF accumulation
cannot accelerate.
6. ROBUSTNESS ANALYSIS
A key insight from our model is that inflation undershoots its long-run target when
prior gaps between realized and targeted inflation prevent FFs from accumulating
quickly enough. We explained how undershooting is related to the exit channel when
discussing Figures 1(a) and 2(b). We also saw undershooting materialize when inflation was increased with aggressive targets in Figure 3(b); inflation was increased
with high-intensity antideflation announcements in Figures 4(b) and 4(c); and inflation was decreased with abrupt targets in Figure 5(a), which we argued is our model’s
counterpart to the data in Figure 6(a). We now establish that our undershooting result
is robust to alternative parameterizations, taking Figure 5(a)—disinflation with an
abrupt target—as the baseline.
To facilitate comparison, the first row of Table 3 presents six quantitative statistics
that summarize the properties of realized inflation in Figure 5(a). The first three
statistics are related to undershooting. We calculate hitting time as the number of
periods it takes inflation to hit the 4% target from above (first column of Table 3).
This corresponds to t1 in Subsection 4.2. We also calculate the fraction of FFs at
hitting time (second column) and the lowest value of inflation realized along the
transition path (third column). In the event of undershooting, the lowest value of
inflation will be noticeably below the 4% target. The next three statistics in Table 3
are related to convergence. We calculate convergence time as the number of periods
until 90% of firms use the FF rule (fourth column). With a sufficiently high fraction of
FFs, mean rationality of the FF rule implies that realized inflation will be very close
to targeted inflation, so we can use the fraction of FFs to assess convergence. We also
report realized inflation at convergence to make sure that it is effectively 4% (fifth
column). Note that the difference between convergence time in the fourth column
and hitting time in the first column captures the amount of time spent undershooting.

NOTES: All inflation rates in this table are reported as fractions. The baseline row summarizes the properties of realized inflation in Figure 5(a).
It is based on N = 1, 000 firms, N random meetings drawn with replacement each period, firms only counting positive strikes, stubbornness
S = 8, mutation θ = 0.02, initial inflation π0 = 0.08, inflation target π t = 0.04 for all t, and taste shock γt ∈ [0.99, 1.01]. The rest of the
rows vary one parameter at a time as indicated. The results in the columns are based on 100 simulations. The first five columns report
averages and are defined as follows: hitting time (in periods) is the first time inflation hits the inflation target from above; %F F at first hit
is the percentage of Fed Followers at the hitting time; minimum inflation is the lowest value of realized inflation along the transition path;
convergence time (in periods) is the first time the percentage of Fed Followers exceeds 90% (80% for the row with θ = 0.05); inflation at
convergence is realized inflation at the convergence time. The last column is the standard deviation of realized inflation at the convergence
time.

Finally, we report the standard deviation of realized inflation at convergence across
simulations to verify that the frequency of convergence is effectively 100% (sixth
column).
The key properties of Figure 5(a) are salient in the first row of Table 3. Around
21% of firms are using the FF rule when inflation first hits the target, so inflation
undershoots to 3.3% before converging to 3.9% once sufficiently many FFs (90%)
have been accumulated.
The second and third rows of Table 3 show the results for different values of the
stubbornness parameter S. Decreasing stubbornness increases the fraction of FFs at
the first hit. With a high fraction of FFs when the target is first hit, both the depth
of undershooting and the amount of time spent undershooting are lower than in
the baseline. Increasing stubbornness has the opposite effect: more undershooting
relative to the baseline and a longer time to convergence after the first hit. These
results confirm the insight that undershooting only occurs when inflation hits the
target with insufficiently many FFs.
The fourth row of Table 3 considers a different mode of interaction. Instead
of tournaments between randomly matched firms, suppose tournaments occur locally: firms are arranged in a circle and each firm meets its right and left neighbors every period. With interactions set up as such, the same firms always meet
each other. This will create clusters of firms that use the same forecasting rule.
Firms at the center of a cluster are thus more likely to meet other firms using the
same rule, increasing their effective stubbornness for any value of S. The fourth
row of Table 3 shows that local interactions increase the time to convergence

KINDA HACHEM AND JING CYNTHIA WU

:

1703

relative to the baseline. This is consistent with local interactions generating more
stubbornness.
The fifth row of Table 3 returns to random interactions but allows for negative
strikes. In particular, suppose randomly matched firms still switch after S = 8 strikes
and still add a strike when outperformed by a different forecasting rule but now
they also subtract a strike when their rule is the outperformer. The idea that agents
respond to both good and bad performance (rather than just bad performance as in the
baseline) is consistent with Brock and Hommes (1997), although we are still using
social dynamics as in our baseline. The fifth row of Table 3 shows that the baseline
results are robust to allowing for negative strikes.
The sixth and seventh rows of Table 3 show that the main messages about undershooting and convergence in the baseline are robust to different values of the mutation
parameter θ . The eighth and ninth rows show that these messages are also robust to
different starting points for initial inflation π0 . The tenth row shows that widening
the support for the taste shock γt also does not have a material impact on the baseline
results.
The last two rows of Table 3 vary the number of random meetings per period in the
baseline to assess the effect of more or less information transmission between firms.
With more meetings, we find that more periods are needed to hit the central bank’s
target for the first time but, once there, undershooting is minimal and convergence
is quick. This is intuitive: increasing the number of meetings without increasing
the number of strikes needed for a rule switch is akin to decreasing the effective
stubbornness of firms with the underperforming rule. RWs (FFs) tend to have the
underperforming rule when realized inflation is close to (far from) the central bank’s
target. With lower effective stubbornness for RWs around the target, FFs start accumulating very quickly and undershooting is minimal. In contrast, when we decrease
the number of meetings per period, undershooting is salient and convergence takes
longer than in the baseline.
7. CONCLUSION
This paper has investigated the effectiveness of central bank announcements when
firms have heterogeneous inflation expectations. We constructed a model of inflation
determination that is tractable and preserves its original nonlinearities. We introduced
the possibility of exit by some firms and showed that this exit channel (i) accommodates two individually mean rational forecasting rules with in-rule heterogeneity and
(ii) puts downward pressure on realized inflation when the mix of rules is sufficiently
interior. We used social dynamics to model the updating of inflation expectations and
endogenize the fraction of firms using each rule. Our model rationalizes why countries
stuck at the zero lower bound have had a hard time increasing inflation without being
aggressive. The same model also predicts that announcing an abrupt target to disinflate will cause inflation to undershoot the target, whereas announcing gradual targets
will not. We presented new empirical evidence that corroborates this prediction.

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1. Let φ(·) and (·) denote the standard normal probability
density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF), respectively.

We can thus write f (σ ) = X − 1−ρ
ln( 1−ρ
) with X dependent on σ as per (A10). To
ρ
make this dependency explicit, we further write X (σ ) in place of just X . Consider
any σ0 > 0 satisfying f (σ0 ) = 0. That is, consider any σ0 > 0 satisfying X (σ0 ) =
1−ρ
U
ln( 1−ρ
). If U ≥ 1 − ρ, then X (σ0 ) ≥ 0, which, given ddσX > σX from the proof of
ρ
Lemma 2, implies X  (σ0 ) > 0. Notice f  (·) = X  (·). This means that, if U ≥ 1 − ρ,
then any σ0 > 0 satisfying f (σ0 ) = 0 must also satisfy f  (σ0 ) > 0. There is thus at
most one σ0 > 0 such that f (σ0 ) = 0. To show exactly one such σ0 > 0, it will suffice
to show limσ →0+ f (σ ) < 0 and limσ →∞ f (σ ) > 0. Equation (A10) yields X (0) ≡
U
) + ln (limσ →0+ −Xσ(σ ) )] . Notice that X (0) > 0
limσ →0+ X (σ ) = (1 − ρ)[ ρ1 ln( 1−ρ
is impossible, while X (0) < 0 is only possible if U < 1 − ρ. Therefore, U ≥ 1 − ρ
U
ln( 1−ρ
) < 0. Equation (A10) also
implies X (0) = 0 and thus limσ →0+ f (σ ) = − 1−ρ
ρ
yields limσ →∞ X (σ ) = ∞ and thus limσ →∞ f (σ ) = ∞. Putting everything together,
we can now conclude that there is exactly one σ0 > 0 such that f (σ0 ) = 0. Moreover,
f  (σ0 ) > 0.
The exit channel behind this result depends on heterogeneity, not on 
πti being a
point expectation. To see this, consider two types of firms j ∈ {1, 2}. The fraction
of type 1 firms is τ and the fraction of type 2 firms is 1 − τ . A type j firm takes
inflation expectations over the entire distribution N (μ, σ j2 ), with the resulting CDF
for its price expectations denoted by F j (·). The price-setting problem with α = 1 still

and f  (0) < 0 when U = U . Taken together, f (0) = 0 and f  (0) < 0 imply existence of a σ > 0 such that f (σ ) < 0. Combined with limσ →∞ f (σ ) = ∞, this
then implies existence of a σ R > 0 satisfying f (σ R ) = 0 and f  (σ R ) > 0. For f (·)
continuous in U , we can thus find an  > 0 such that there also exists a σ R > 0
satisfying f (σ R ) = 0 and f  (σ R ) > 0 when U ∈ (U − , U ). To show existence
of a σ F ∈ (0, σ R ) satisfying f (σ F ) = 0 and f  (σ F ) < 0, it will suffice to show
f (0) = 0 and f  (0) > 0 when U ∈ (U − , U ). If f  (0) = 0, then it will suffice
to show f (0) = 0 and f  (0) ≡ limσ →0+ f  (σ ) > 0. For any U ∈ (0, U ), we have
X (0) ∈ (−∞, 0) from (A16) and thus f (0) = 0 from (A14). We also have X  (0) =

limσ →0+ ( Xσ(σ ) )2 φ(− Xσ(σ ) ) = 0 from (A9) and the property limz→−∞ z 2 φ(−z) =

The variable yt is just excess inflation scaled up by a constant. The variable xt provides
a more compact way to express the operation condition in equation (2). In particular,
if the difference between a firm’s inflation forecast and the mean forecast is greater
than or equal to xt , then the firm operates. With a mixture of normal expectations,
equations (2) and (4) yield xt implicitly defined by:23
