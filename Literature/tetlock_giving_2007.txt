Giving Content to Investor Sentiment:
The Role of Media in the Stock Market
PAUL C. TETLOCK∗
ABSTRACT
I quantitatively measure the interactions between the media and the stock market
using daily content from a popular Wall Street Journal column. I find that high media
pessimism predicts downward pressure on market prices followed by a reversion to
fundamentals, and unusually high or low pessimism predicts high market trading
volume. These and similar results are consistent with theoretical models of noise and
liquidity traders, and are inconsistent with theories of media content as a proxy for
new information about fundamental asset values, as a proxy for market volatility, or
as a sideshow with no relationship to asset markets.

One of the more fascinating sections of the WSJ is on the inside of the
back page under the standing headline “Abreast of the Market.” There
you can read each day what the market did yesterday, whether it went up,
down or sideways as measured by indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial
Average . . . . In that column, you can also read selected post-mortems from
brokerage houses, stock analysts and other professional track watchers
explaining why the market yesterday did whatever it did, sometimes with
predictive nuggets about what it will do today or tomorrow. This is where
the fascination lies. For no matter what the market did—up, down or
sideways—somebody will have a ready explanation.

CASUAL OBSERVATION SUGGESTS THAT THE CONTENT OF NEWS about the stock market could be linked to investor psychology and sociology. However, it is unclear
whether the financial news media induces, amplifies, or simply ref lects investors’ interpretations of stock market performance. This paper attempts to

characterize the relationship between the content of media reports and daily
stock market activity, focusing on the immediate inf luence of the Wall Street
Journal’s (WSJ’s) “Abreast of the Market” column on U.S. stock market returns.
To my knowledge, this paper is the first to find evidence that news media
content can predict movements in broad indicators of stock market activity.
Using principal components analysis, I construct a simple measure of media
pessimism from the content of the WSJ column. I then estimate the intertemporal links between this measure of media pessimism and the stock market using
basic vector autoregressions (VARs). First and foremost, I find that high levels of media pessimism robustly predict downward pressure on market prices,
followed by a reversion to fundamentals. Second, unusually high or low values
of media pessimism forecast high market trading volume. Third, low market
returns lead to high media pessimism. These findings suggest that measures
of media content serve as a proxy for investor sentiment or noninformational
trading. By contrast, statistical tests reject the hypothesis that media content
contains new information about fundamental asset values and the hypothesis
that media content is a sideshow with no relation to asset markets.
I use the General Inquirer (GI), a well-known quantitative content analysis
program, to analyze daily variation in the WSJ “Abreast of the Market” column over the 16-year period 1984–1999. This column is a natural choice for
a data source that both ref lects and inf luences investor sentiment for three
reasons. First, the WSJ has by far the largest circulation—over two million
readers—of any daily financial publication in the United States, and Dow Jones
Newswires, the preferred medium for electronic WSJ distribution, reaches over
325,000 finance and investment professionals.1 Second, the WSJ and Dow
Jones Newswires, founded in 1889 and 1897, respectively, are extremely well
established and have strong reputations with investors. Third, electronic texts
of the WSJ “Abreast of the Market” column are accessible over a longer time
horizon than are the texts of any other column about the stock market.2
For each day in the sample, I gather newspaper data by counting the words
in all 77 predetermined GI categories from the Harvard psychosocial dictionary.
To mitigate measurement error and thereby enhance construct validity, I perform a principal components factor analysis of these categories. This process
collapses the 77 categories into a single media factor that captures the maximum variance in the GI categories. Because this single media factor is strongly
related to pessimistic words in the newspaper column, hereafter I refer to it as
a pessimism factor.
In standard return predictability regressions, changes in this pessimism factor predict statistically significant and economically meaningful changes in the
distribution of daily U.S. stock returns and volume. I confirm the robustness
of this relationship by looking at the sensitivity of the results to the timing

of information and to the use of different measures of pessimism. The results remain the same when I allow for a significant time gap between the
release of media pessimism and the event return window. I also replicate the
results using alternative measures of media pessimism based on the original GI categories. Using the GI category for either Negative words or Weak
words (the two GI categories most highly correlated with pessimism), I find
similar relationships between the media and the market. This approach to modeling behavioral phenomena yields factors and corresponding regression coefficients that can be readily interpreted in terms of well-established psychological
variables.
Section I provides motivation for studying the impact of the media on the
stock market. Section II describes the factor analysis of the content of the daily
“Abreast of the Market” column in the Wall Street Journal. Section III reports
myriad tests of whether the pessimism media factor correlates with future stock
market activity. In Section IV, I interpret the pessimism factor in terms of investor sentiment and show that the risk premium explanation does not explain
the results. I conclude in Section V with a brief discussion of the results and
suggestions for future research on the inf luence of media in asset markets.
Finally, because this study relies heavily on a technique unfamiliar to many
economists, the Appendix introduces the method of quantitative content analysis as it is employed in this study—for more detailed information, see Riffe,
Lacy, and Fico (1998).
I. Theory and Background
Since John Maynard Keynes coined the term “animal spirits” 70 years ago,
economists have devoted substantial attention to trying to understand the determinants of wild movements in stock market prices that are seemingly unjustified by fundamentals (see Keynes (1936)). Cutler, Poterba, and Summers
(1989) is one of the first empirical studies to explore the link between news coverage and stock prices. Surprisingly, the authors find that important qualitative
news stories do not seem to help explain large market returns unaccompanied
by quantitative macroeconomic events.
Two recent studies identify interesting relationships between trading volume
and measures of communication activity. Antweiler and Frank (2004) study
messages in Internet chat rooms focused on stocks, characterizing the content
of the messages as “buy,” “sell,” or “hold” recommendations. Although they do
not find a statistically or economically significant effect of “bullish” messages on
returns, Antweiler and Frank (2004) do find evidence of relationships between
message activity and trading volume and message activity and return volatility.
Similarly, Coval and Shumway (2001) establish that the ambient noise level in
a futures pit is linked to volume, volatility, and depth—but not returns.
Most theoretical models of the effect of investor sentiment on stock market pricing make two important assumptions (see, e.g., DeLong et al. (1990a)).
First, these models posit the existence of two types of traders, noise traders
who hold random beliefs about future dividends and rational arbitrageurs who

1142

The Journal of Finance

hold Bayesian beliefs. In this paper, I refer to the level of noise traders’ beliefs
relative to Bayesian beliefs as investor sentiment. For example, when noise
traders have expectations of future dividends that are below the expectations
of rational arbitrageurs, I call their beliefs pessimistic. Further, I assume that
these misperceptions of dividends are stationary, implying that beliefs do not
stray arbitrarily far from Bayesian expectations over time.
Second, these models assume that both types of traders have downwardsloping demand for risky assets because they are risk averse, capital constrained, or otherwise impaired from freely buying and selling risky assets.
These assumptions lead to an equilibrium in which noise traders’ random beliefs about future dividends inf luence prices. Specifically, when noise traders
experience a negative belief shock, they sell stocks to arbitrageurs, increasing
volume and temporarily depressing returns. However, because these shocks are
stationary, on average returns rebound next period when there is a new belief
shock. Models of investor sentiment such as DeLong et al. (1990a) therefore predict that low sentiment will generate downward price pressure and unusually
high or low values of sentiment will generate high volume.
More generally, models of trade for any noninformational reason, such as liquidity needs or sudden changes in risk aversion, make these same predictions.
For example, Campbell, Grossman, and Wang (1993) model how changes in the
level of risk aversion for a large subset of investors can affect short-term returns. The only way to distinguish noise trader and liquidity trader theories is
to interpret the media pessimism variable as a proxy for either investor sentiment or risk aversion. Because this debate is more philosophical than economic,
I defer to the reader to draw her own conclusions.
The timing of media pessimism is important in each theory. This paper
tests the specific hypothesis that high media pessimism is associated with
low investor sentiment, resulting in downward pressure on prices. It is unclear whether media pessimism forecasts investor sentiment or ref lects past
investor sentiment. If the former hypothesis is correct, then one would expect
high media pessimism to predict low returns at short horizons and a reversion to fundamentals at longer horizons. If the latter theory is correct, then
one would expect high media pessimism to follow low returns and predict high
returns in the future.
The most likely scenario, however, is that both theories have an element
of truth. If media pessimism serves as a proxy for periods of low past and
future investor sentiment, one would expect to find that high pessimism follows periods of low past returns, forecasts low future returns at short horizons,
and predicts high future returns at longer horizons. Insofar as pessimism ref lects past investor sentiment, the high long-horizon returns will exceed the low
short-horizon returns. These predictions concerning returns are summarized
in Figure 1.
One alternative hypothesis is that the media pessimism measure is a proxy
for negative information about the fundamental values of equities that is not
currently incorporated into prices. If pessimism ref lects negative news about
past and future cash f lows rather than sentiment, then one would still observe

1143

Figure 1. Impact of a negative sentiment shock on prices. The graph depicts the theoretical impact of a one-time increase in negative investor sentiment on equity prices. If the media
pessimism measure is a predictor of investor sentiment, it will predict low short-horizon returns
followed by high long-horizon returns of approximately equal magnitude. If the media pessimism
measure follows past investor sentiment, it will predict low short-horizon returns followed by high
long-horizon returns of greater magnitude than the short-horizon returns.

a negative relationship between media pessimism and short-horizon returns.
However, the sentiment and information theories make different predictions
about long-horizon returns and volume: The sentiment theory predicts shorthorizon returns will be reversed in the long run, whereas the information theory
predicts they will persist indefinitely.
Although this discussion focuses on extreme views of the newspaper column
as either pure noise or pure information, it is possible that the column contains
only some information, but that traders over- or underreact to this information.
I explore these possibilities further in the empirical tests in Section III.
Another theory of media pessimism is that it is a proxy for negative information about dividends that is already incorporated into prices. This theory
predicts media pessimism should have no effect on future market activity. Similarly, if one believes that the media pessimism measure contains no information
about past, present, and future dividends, then one would not expect to observe
any impact of pessimism on market activity. Many economists who have read
the “Abreast of the Market” column in the WSJ support some variant of this
theory, believing the column’s goal is to entertain readers.
Trading volume provides another measure of market behavior for assessing
theories of media pessimism. If media pessimism either ref lects past or predicts
future investor sentiment, unusually high or low levels of pessimism should be
associated with increases in trading volume. More precisely, if pessimism has

1144

The Journal of Finance

a mean of zero, then the absolute value of pessimism is high in times when
irrational investors trade with rational investors.3 Although the sentiment
theory makes a clear prediction about the relationship between volume and
pessimism, the information theory makes no obvious prediction.4 Finally, the
stale or no information theory predicts no effect of media pessimism on trading
volume.
II. Generating the Pessimism Media Factor
As a completely automated program, the General Inquirer (GI) produces a
systematic and easily replicable analysis of the WSJ column. The GI employs
an extremely rudimentary measurement rule for converting the column into
numeric values, namely, it counts the number of words in each day’s column that
fall within various word categories. The word categories are neither mutually
exclusive nor exhaustive—one word may fall into multiple categories and some
words are not categorized at all. To reduce redundancy in categorization, I use
only the most recent versions of categories in the General Inquirer’s Harvard
IV-4 psychosocial dictionary.
To minimize semantic and stylistic noise in the column, I recenter all GI
categories so that their conditional means are equal across different days of the
week. This ensures that I do not select media factors that capture the systematic
variation in the WSJ column on different days of the week. I use day-of-theweek dummy variables in the regressions in the next section to control for the
possibility that market behavior differs across different days of the week.
I employ a principal components factor analysis to extract the most important semantic component from the (77 × 77) variance–covariance matrix of the
categories in the Harvard dictionary. This process is designed to detect complex structure in the WSJ column and to eliminate the redundant categories in
the dictionary. Factor analysis assumes the existence of an underlying media
factor—a linear combination of GI categories that is not directly observable.5
Variation in this factor over time generates the observed daily correlations between the various GI categories.
Operationally, factor analysis chooses the vector in the 77-dimensional GI
category space with the greatest variance, where each GI category is given
equal weight in the total variance calculation. I explore other factor analysis
3
Most models in finance focus on trades between groups of noise traders and rational traders.
Traditional no-trade theorems suggest that within-group trades among rational traders should
not occur. Furthermore, for noise traders to have an impact on prices, there must be a common
component in the variation in their beliefs. This paper focuses on the common component of noise
trader beliefs that could affect prices.
4
Of course, it is possible that new information produces divergence in opinion, which would
lead to increases in volume. On the other hand, it seems equally likely that agents’ beliefs would
converge when all agents observe the same piece of public information.
5
In an earlier version of this paper, I consider the top three factors, some of which have interesting interpretations. Adding additional factors to the regressions shown here does not substantially
alter the results because all factors are mutually orthogonal by construction.

techniques, such as principal factors analysis and maximum-likelihood factor
analysis. The qualitative empirical conclusions are not sensitive to the methodology chosen, and the quantitative conclusions change only minimally. For the
remainder of this paper, I present the results using the single factor identified
by principal components analysis that captures the maximum variation in GI
categories. Effectively, principal components analysis performs a singular value
decomposition of the correlation matrix of GI categories measured over time.
The single factor selected in this study is the eigenvector in the decomposition
with the highest eigenvalue.
Because this singular value decomposition uses only the GI category variables in the correlation matrix, completely disregarding all stock market variables, the resulting media factor may not correspond to any traditional measurements of past market performance. Also, because I do not subjectively eliminate any categories, the factor analysis generates a media factor that equally
considers all sources of variation in the WSJ column, even though it is likely
that some categories are more relevant for measuring investor sentiment.6
Theoretical imprecision is the cost of avoiding data mining. To facilitate the
interpretation of the single factor chosen, I adopt a complementary approach
to creating a summary media variable later in the paper.
The principal components analysis exploits time variation in GI category
word counts to identify the media factor. To avoid data mining and any lookahead bias in the regressions that follow, I construct the media factor using
only information available to traders. I estimate the factor loadings in year t −
1 using principal components analysis. Then I use these loadings, along with
the daily word counts in year t, to calculate the values of the factor throughout
year t. Because this procedure does not guarantee any consistency in factor
loadings across years, it is possible that changes in the structure of media
content over time cause this procedure to generate a meaningless factor. For
example, if the column writer focuses on different issues in different years, then
this procedure will generate a single factor that covaries with different issues
in different years.
To examine whether time variation in the GI categories is stable and whether
the above procedure is reasonable, I analyze the relationship between the loadings used in each yearly factor. For each year in the data sample, I use the
loadings estimated from that year to calculate the value of the hypothetical
value of the yearly factor in all years. Then I compare the correlations for these
hypothetical yearly factors across the entire sample.
Fortunately, the media factor estimated using the loadings from any given
year looks very similar to the media factor estimated using another year’s loadings. In Table I, I report the correlation matrix of yearly factors. The average
pairwise correlation between the yearly media factors is 0.96 and the average
squared correlation is 0.91. The minimum pairwise correlation is 0.80, suggesting all pairs of media factors are very highly correlated. I conclude from this
6

For example, investors may not care how many religious words appear in the column each day.
Nevertheless, the GI dictionary devotes an entire category to tracking these words.

Correlations of the Media Factors Constructed Yearly
The table data come from the General Inquirer program. This table shows correlations between
media factors constructed using factor analysis on the GI categories in different years. The mean
pairwise correlation for a given yearly factor excludes the factor’s correlation with itself. Each
yearly media factor is the linear combination of GI categories that captures the maximum variance
in GI categories in that year. The factor analysis method is that of principal components analysis,
which is equivalent to a singular value decomposition. Each yearly factor analysis is based on news
columns from roughly 250 trading days per year. All GI category variables have been demeaned by
day of the week using the prior year’s mean.

analysis that the loadings on the individual GI categories are quite stable over
time.
Each yearly factor analysis can be interpreted in terms of the underlying GI
categories. The average of the first eigenvalue in each yearly factor analysis
is 6.72, implying that the first factor contributes as much variance in media
content as more than six of the original GI category variables. This first factor
is approximately equal to a linear combination with positive weights on just
4 of the 77 GI categories: Negative, words associated with a negative outlook;
Weak, words implying weakness; Fail, words indicating that goals have not
been achieved; and Fall, words associated with falling movement. In fact, the
Negative and Weak GI categories each can explain over 57% of the variance in
the first factor. This factor also negatively weights categories such as Positive,
words associated with a positive outlook;7 however, the negative relationship
between the factor and Positive words is not as strong as the positive relationship between the factor and Negative words.
7
Intuitively, the number of Positive and Negative words in the column is strongly negatively
correlated, holding constant the total number of words. Thus, it is natural that one media factor
captures the variation in both Positive and Negative words.

On days in which the WSJ column loads highly on this first factor, it probably
contains negative interpretations of market events. These interpretations may
or may not correspond to objectively negative news about corporate earnings
and other relevant economic indicators. Hereafter, I use the term pessimism
factor to refer to this first media factor.
In thinking about the pessimism factor, it is important to remember that
the typical “Abreast of the Market” column reads like a post-mortem of the
market’s life on the prior day.8 The WSJ’s “Abreast of the Market” column is
written immediately after the closing bell on Wall Street on the most recent
day of market activity. In fact, the writing process usually begins even before
the closing bell at 2:30–3:00 p.m. EST. It is unlikely that the column contains
any information unknown to the specialists on the f loor of the exchange at the
conclusion of trading. Nevertheless, in robustness tests shown below, I introduce
a significant time gap between the release of the column in the afternoon and
the beginning of the event return window. The same column produced and
released by Dow Jones Newswires each afternoon is republished in the WSJ on
the morning of the next day of market activity.
III. Market Activity and Pessimism
The market returns regressions, I present below control for many known
sources of predictability found in daily return data. In a frictionless complete
market in which traders have rational expectations, financial theory predicts
daily prices will follow a random walk with drift (Samuelson (1965)). More
generally, classic arbitrage arguments suggest that prices should approximate
a random walk with drift. However, market microstructure phenomena, such
as bid-ask bounce, nonsynchronous trading, and transactions costs, sully the
purity of the theoretical prediction. Some of these mechanisms induce statistical
artifacts that make observed returns appear autocorrelated; other mechanisms
lead to genuine return autocorrelation.9
With these caveats in mind, this study attempts to control for the inf luence
of the lagged returns of indices and the lagged returns of any leading, larger indices. Regressions also include lagged volume to try to capture liquidity effects.
Finally, lagged return volatility acts as a proxy for the inf luence of several other
market frictions. The return and volatility predictability regressions control for
all lags up to 5 trading days, that is, at least 1 week of calendar time.
8
Journalists, not economic or financial experts, write the column. A typical writer has a B.A.
degree in Journalism and has taken few, if any, courses in economics. The column writers sometimes
leave their offices in Jersey City to go to the f loor of the stock exchange in Manhattan in search of
opinion quotes from strategists and traders, but usually they ask market participants questions
by telephone. On the whole, the writers consider their columns “more art than science.”
9
Bid-ask spreads can induce negative autocorrelation in the return time series when trades alternately occur at the bid and ask prices. Nonsynchronous trading causes spurious cross-correlations
and autocorrelations in stock returns because quoted closing prices are not equally spaced at 24hour intervals (see Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1995)). Transaction costs such as trading fees
and short-run capital gains taxes preclude arbitrage strategies that would mitigate return predictability.

1148

The Journal of Finance

This study runs two main sets of regressions to test whether the pessimism
factor predicts returns and volume beyond known sources of predictability. In
the first set of tests, I adopt a vector autoregressive (VAR) framework in which
I simultaneously estimate the relationships among returns, volume, and the
pessimism factor. In the second set of tests, I examine the robustness of these
results. Finally, I assess the economic importance of the return predictability
and whether it implies there are profitable sentiment-based trading strategies.
A. VAR Estimates
Because Dow Jones and Company produces the WSJ and the “Abreast of the
Market” column focuses on the stocks in the Dow Jones index, I test whether
pessimism forecasts daily returns on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow).
In addition, because previous authors (e.g., DeLong et al. (1990a)) suggest that
investor sentiment plays a larger role in the pricing of small stocks, I consider
whether pessimism forecasts the returns to the Fama and French (1993) daily
small-minus-big (SMB) factor. As a measure of volume, I look at the detrended
log of daily volume (Vlm) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).10
I obtain a time series of daily returns from January 1, 1984 to September
17, 1999 from the Wharton Research Data Services’ access to the historical
Dow Jones Industrial Averages. This sample period encompasses almost 4,000
observations of market returns; each year consists of only about 250 data points
because the U.S. stock market is idle on weekends and national holidays.
All VAR estimates include all lags up to 5 days prior to market activity. The
endogenous variables in the first VAR are Dow, the pessimism media factor
(BdNws), and Vlm.11 The exogenous variables include five lags of the detrended
squared Dow residuals to proxy for past volatility,12 dummy variables for dayof-the-week and January to control for other potential return anomalies, and
a dummy variable for the October 19, 1987 stock market crash to ensure the
results are not driven by this single observation.13 Newey and West (1987)
robust standard errors account for any heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation
in the residuals up to five lags.
It is convenient to define the variable Exog, which represents all of the
exogenous variables. I also define a lag operator, L5, that transforms any
10
I focus on detrended log volume because the level of log volume is not stationary. I use a
detrending methodology based on Campbell, Grossman, and Wang (1993). Specifically, I calculate
the volume trend as a rolling average of the past 60 days of log volume. All results below are robust
to using 30-day and 360-day averages.
11
The time series of daily NYSE volume comes from the NYSE database.
12
Specifically, I demean the Dow variable to obtain a residual, I square this residual, and then
I subtract the past 60-day moving average of the squared residual. All results below are robust
to using alternative detrended measures of past volatility in which I subtract the past 30-day or
360-day moving average of squared residuals from current squared residuals. The results for other
volatility measures such as the CBOE’s volatility index (VIX) are qualitatively similar.
13
Interestingly, measures of pessimism seem to have been abnormally high prior to the 1987
crash, which is consistent with the findings below. I also verify that winsorizing all variables at
the 0.5% upper and lower tails of their distributions does not affect the results.

variable xt into a row vector consisting of the five lags of xt , that is, L5(xt ) =
[xt−1 xt−2 xt−3 xt−4 xt−5 ]. With these definitions, the returns equation for the
first VAR can be expressed as
Dowt = α1 + β1 · L5(Dowt ) + γ1 · L5(BdNwst )
+ δ1 · L5(V l mt ) + λ1 · E xo g t−1 + ε1t .

(1)

To account for time-varying return volatility, I assume that the disturbance
term ε t is heteroskedastic across time. Because the disturbance terms in the
volume and media variables equations have no obvious relation to disturbances
in the returns equation, I assume that these disturbance terms are independent. Relaxing the assumption of independence across equations does not affect
the results.
Assuming independence allows me to estimate each equation separately using standard ordinary least squares (OLS) techniques. Thus, the VAR estimates
are equivalent to the Granger causality tests first suggested by Granger (1969).
The OLS estimates of the coefficients γ 1 in equation (1) are the primary focus
of this study. These coefficients describe the dependence of the Dow Jones index
on the pessimism factor. Table II summarizes the estimates of γ 1 .
The p-value for the null hypothesis that the five lags of the pessimism factor

impact of a one-standard deviation change in pessimism on the next day’s Dow
Jones returns is 8.1 basis points, which is larger than the unconditional mean
of Dow Jones returns (5.4 basis points).
Consistent with the model in Campbell, Grossman, and Wang (1993), this
negative inf luence is only temporary and is almost fully reversed later in the
trading week. The magnitude of the reversal in lags two through five is 6.8
basis points, which is significantly different from zero at the 5% level. Thus,
I can reject the hypothesis of no reversal and the hypothesis of return continuation following pessimistic news. However, I cannot reject the hypothesis
that the 6.8 basis point reversal in lags two through five exactly offsets the
initial decline in returns of 8.1 basis points, that is, the sum of the coefficients
on the five lags of pessimism (−1.3 basis points) is not significantly different
from zero. Assuming the newspaper column contains no relevant information
about fundamentals, the market’s long-run reaction is consistent with market efficiency and provides no support for theories of over- or underreaction
to news.
The evidence of an initial decline and subsequent reversal is consistent with
neither the new information nor the stale information theories of the newspaper column. If the column contained new information about fundamentals,
there could be an initial decline in returns, but this would not be followed by
a complete return reversal. If the column contains only information already
incorporated into prices, media pessimism would not significantly inf luence
returns. The evidence is consistent, however, with temporary downward price
pressure caused by pessimistic investor sentiment.
The second and third regressions in Table II examine whether the GI word
categories Negative and Weak underlying the pessimism factor also serve as
proxies for investor sentiment. All independent variables in the second and
third regressions are the same as in the original specification except that the
pessimism factor has been replaced by the Negative category and the Weak category, respectively. If the pessimism factor is truly a proxy for negative investor
sentiment, then it is reasonable to expect that the GI word categories comprising pessimism should bear the same qualitative relationship to future returns
as the pessimism factor. The Negative and Weak word categories capture the
psychological intuition behind investor sentiment.
Table II shows that one-standard deviation increases in Negative words and
Weak words predict that the Dow Jones will fall by 4.4 and 6.0 basis points,
respectively. Both magnitudes are statistically and economically significant,
and are comparable to the pessimism effect. The table also shows that the return reversals in days two through five following increases in Negative and
Weak words are even larger than the reversal following pessimism. The delayed increase in returns is 9.5 basis points for Negative words and 10.7 basis
points for Weak words, both of which are strongly economically and statistically
significant (p-values < 0.01).
All three measures of pessimism exert an effect on returns that is an order
of magnitude greater than typical bid-ask spreads for Dow Jones stocks. Thus,
bid-ask bounce is unlikely to explain the results. Based on the evidence in
Table II, I conclude that the negative sentiment has a significant temporary

impact on future Dow Jones returns that is fully reversed within one
week.14
It is also interesting to look at the effect of returns and other economic variables on the content of the newspaper column. If the pessimism factor is a
reasonable measure of the content of the column, then economic variables from
the recent past may predict the values of the pessimism factor. The VAR equation below describes this relationship:
BdNwst = α2 + β2 · L5(Dowt ) + γ2 · L5(BdNwst )
+ δ2 · L5(V l mt ) + λ2 · E xo g t−1 + ε2t .

(2)

Table III presents OLS estimates of β 2 , which represents the impact of
past Dow Jones returns on pessimism, for all three measures of pessimism.
Table III reverses the causal link posited in Table II. The table indicates
that negative returns predict more pessimism in the next day’s WSJ column,
which is consistent with the positive feedback trading theory in DeLong et al.
(1990b). The magnitude of the pessimism coefficient implies that a 1% decrease
in the prior day’s returns on the Dow leads to a significant increase in pessimism equal to 5.8% of one standard deviation of the pessimism media factor
(p-value = 0.003).
The VAR equation that models NYSE volume provides another measure of
the pessimism factor’s inf luence on market activity. Prior research suggests
14
To assess whether the power of the statistical tests is the driving force behind the significant
pessimism effects, I also examine the VAR equation (1) estimates of β 1 , δ 1 , and λ1 , which measure
the impact of past returns, volatility, volume, and other controls. After omitting the 1% outliers,
none of these variables has a statistically significant impact on future Dow Jones returns at the 10%
level. This suggests that even relatively weak statistical tests can resolve the effects of pessimism
on returns.

1152

The Journal of Finance

that financial media coverage could be related to exchange volume. Other measures of communication such as those used in Coval and Shumway (2001) and
Antweiler and Frank (2004) are related to the costs of trading, liquidity, and
volume. If pessimism proxies for trading costs, then increases in pessimism
should lead to declines in trading volume.
The model in Campbell et al. (1993) provides another rationale for why
pessimism could be related to volume. For simplicity, suppose the mean
value of media pessimism is zero. High absolute values of pessimism indicate that a group of liquidity traders will suddenly decide to buy or sell equity. Market makers must absorb the demands for equity from these liquidity traders to restore equilibrium, inducing abnormally high trading volume.
Thus, high absolute values of pessimism should forecast high trading volume
until liquidity trading subsides. Although DeLong et al. (1990a) do not explicitly model trading volume, their model makes similar predictions about
the behavior of liquidity traders when the absolute value of sentiment is
high.
In summary, theories of media pessimism as a proxy for trading costs predict
that pessimism decreases volume, whereas theories of pessimism as a proxy
for sentiment such as Campbell et al. (1993) and DeLong et al. (1990a) predict
that the absolute value of pessimism will increase volume. Accordingly, I add
five lags of the pessimism factor and the absolute value of this factor to the
OLS specification for volume:
Vlmt = α3 + β3 · L5(Dowt ) + γ3 · L5(BdNwst )
+ ψ3 · L5(|BdNwst |) + δ3 · L5(Vlmt ) + λ3 · Exogt−1 + ε3t .

(3)

Table IV depicts the coefficients γ 3 and ψ 3 on the pessimism factor. Each coefficient in the table describes the impact of a one standard deviation increase
in pessimism on detrended log NYSE volume. Again, I estimate the impact of
pessimism using all three measures of pessimism.
There is some evidence that pessimism plays a direct role in forecasting volume, tentatively supporting the idea that pessimism is a proxy for trading costs.
The first lags of Negative and Weak words are significantly negative predictors of volume. However, this result is attenuated when I winsorize the 1%
outliers. Nevertheless, I cannot completely rule out theories that posit a direct
link between pessimistic communication and volume.
An interpretation of pessimism as a measure of risk aversion or sentiment
receives much more support from the volume regressions. Consistent with the
theories of Campbell et al. (1993) and DeLong et al. (1990a), the absolute value
of pessimism significantly predicts increases in volume on the next trading
day. This result holds regardless of whether pessimism is measured by the
pessimism factor, Negative words, or Weak words (p-values < 0.01).15 The
straightforward interpretation is that high absolute values of pessimism are
15
The subsequent reversal in volume is strongly significant for the pessimism factor, but not for
Negative or Weak words. Theories of sentiment make ambiguous predictions about whether this
volume reversal should occur depending on the exact mechanism of price adjustment. Volume may

a proxy for disagreement between noise traders and rational traders, which
leads to increases in trading volume on the next trading day.16
Next, I consider the effect of the pessimism factor on measures of market
returns other than the Dow Jones index. It is well known that small stocks
have the highest individual investor ownership. If the pessimism factor measures the investor sentiment of individual investors, then perhaps it should
predict the returns on small stocks. To test this theory, I obtain data on the
daily Fama–French small-minus-big (SMB) factor constructed as in Fama and
French (1993). I use this factor rather than an index of small stocks because
its performance does not correlate highly with Dow Jones returns. The results
above already show that the media factors predict the returns on the Dow.
The tests here examine whether the media factors predict small stock returns
independent of their ability to predict returns on the Dow.
To predict the SMB factor, I adopt a regression specification that is analogous
to the VAR equations above. In other words, I control for five lags of returns
remain high if liquidity traders repurchase their former positions when sentiment reverts to its
mean, or volume may subside because prices adjust without substantial trading.
16
Intuitively, the absolute value of pessimism is also associated with high contemporaneous
trading volume.

Table V reports the coefficients γ 4 on the pessimism factor in the SMB factor
regression. Each coefficient in the regression measures the impact in basis
points of a one-standard deviation increase in pessimism on daily SMB factor
returns.
The main result is that all three pessimism measures significantly predict
negative returns to the SMB factor over the following week (p-values of 0.034,
0.008, and 0.018 for pessimism, Negative, and Weak). Relative to its effect on
the Dow Jones returns, the effect of negative sentiment on SMB returns appears
to be longer lasting. The sum of the coefficients on each of the three negative
sentiment measures in Table V is statistically and economically significant
(p-values < 0.020 and magnitude of roughly five basis points). Thus, negative
sentiment seems to have a longer-lasting and larger impact on small stocks.
The results up to this point suggest that pessimism in the WSJ column predicts lower returns on the Dow, and lower returns on the Dow predicts increased pessimism. However, a reasonable reader could be skeptical of these

Giving Content to Investor Sentiment

1155

conclusions. For instance, if the afternoon WSJ column (written at the close of
the prior trading day) contains late-breaking information not completely incorporated in closing prices, then investors may continue to react to news in the
column on the next trading day, in which case the results above are generally
consistent with conventional models in finance that do not allow for the existence of liquidity or noise traders. In other words, theories of media content as a
proxy for information about fundamental asset values could be consistent with
some of the regression results shown above.17 In the next section, I investigate
this possibility and report the findings from other robustness and sensitivity
tests.
B. Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis
The newswires containing the information necessary to calculate the pessimism factor appear at the close of afternoon trading, which is the beginning
of the close-to-close return measurement period for the next day. Thus, it seems
possible that a slight time lag between the release of the WSJ column and its
incorporation into prices is driving the return and volume predictability results
shown above. The question is whether the predictive power of the pessimism
factor is concentrated in after-hours and opening hour returns or is dispersed
uniformly throughout the trading day.
To address this issue, I reestimate the regressions above with a return window that allows traders more time to react to any information released in the
afternoon newswires. I also allow traders some time to react to the same information reprinted in the paper WSJ the next morning. Specifically, I use a
return window that begins on 10 a.m. the day after the column is released on
the newswires. I also add control variables in the return regressions to capture
the inf luence of closing and opening returns and volume. I use data on intraday
Dow Jones index levels from Global Financial Data, Inc. to measure the returns
on the Dow Jones from the close of the prior trading day to 10 a.m. on the current trading day. I then reestimate equation (1) with the more conservative
return window.18
Even if the predictive power of the pessimism factor comes from its ability to
predict investor sentiment and is dispersed uniformly throughout the trading
day, the coefficients on the lags of pessimism in equation (1) should decline
in magnitude after eliminating close-to-open and opening-30-minute returns
from the dependent variable. This decline occurs because the ability of the
pessimism factor to predict returns is presumably dispersed throughout the
period that includes after-hours and opening-30-minute trading. It is possible,
in fact, that pessimism has its greatest causal impact on returns just after
17
The return reversals above would still be difficult to reconcile with theories of pessimism as a
proxy for information about fundamentals.
18
Including additional controls for opening-hour returns and log NYSE volume does not change
the results. See infra for a description of these variables.

traders have read the afternoon newswires or the morning newspaper. Indeed,
over 25% of daily trading volume on the NYSE occurs within this time frame.
Unfortunately, there is no way to disentangle this early impact of pessimism
from the hypothesis that traders slowly react to information released in the
column.
Table VI reports the results from estimating equation (1) with the new return
window as the dependent variable. For all three measures of sentiment, the
hypothesis that negative sentiment does not predict the next day’s returns on
the Dow Jones between 10 a.m. and market closing time can be rejected at the
99% level. Moreover, the magnitude of the next day’s coefficients in Table VI
fall by at most 25% relative to the corresponding coefficients in Table II. A
decline of at least 25% would be expected if the negative effect of sentiment is
uniformly distributed across trading volume. This suggests that, if anything,
the measures of negative sentiment considered in this paper have their largest
impact later in the trading day.
Also consistent with the results above, Table VI shows that the impact of
negative sentiment on returns is either fully or mostly reversed over the next
few days, depending on the exact sentiment measure used. The reversal is
complete and strongly statistically significant for Negative and Weak words;
the reversal accounts for over 85% of the decline and is marginally statistically
significant for the pessimism factor. Based on Table VI, I conclude that negative

Giving Content to Investor Sentiment

1157

sentiment predicts returns throughout the ensuing trading day and subsequent
reversals later in the week, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that
traders slowly react to information released in the column.
I also scrutinize the relationship between NYSE volume and the measures
of pessimism to assess whether pessimism’s effect on trading volume endures
beyond any plausible immediate response to the release of information about
pessimism. Specifically, I subtract the next trading day’s opening-hour NYSE
volume from the dependent variable in the regression specification in equation
(3) to obtain a measure of after-morning volume.
To retest the hypothesis that pessimism is a proxy for trading costs, I assess
whether yesterday’s pessimism media factor directly forecasts today’s aftermorning volume. The insignificant coefficients on BdNwst−1 in Table VII suggest that none of the three measures of pessimism plays this role. That is,
the direct effect of pessimism on volume is mostly attributable to its effect on
opening-hour volume. It seems that pessimism does not directly forecast volume, though it may still be a proxy for past or contemporaneous trading costs.
Interestingly, the results in Table VII suggest that the absolute values of the
measures of pessimism still have strong effects on the next day’s NYSE volume

above and beyond their immediate impact on opening-hour volume. For all
three sentiment measures, after-morning volume increases by over 1% when
sentiment is above or below its mean by one standard deviation. This impact
is statistically significant at the 99% level for Negative and Weak words and
the 95% level for the pessimism factor. These results are again consistent with
interpretations of the absolute value of pessimism as a proxy for unusually high
or low demand from liquidity traders as in Campbell et al. (1993) or from noise
traders as in DeLong et al. (1990a).
I perform a similar test to that used in Table VII to examine the robustness
of the effect of pessimism on the Fama and French (1993) SMB factor. Again,
the goal is to assess whether SMB returns are affected by pessimism measures
long after information about pessimism has been released. Because the prices
of small stocks are particularly slow to adjust to information, I do not use the
prior day’s pessimism factor to try to predict the SMB factor. To err on the
side of caution, I use only negative sentiment measures based on newspaper
columns printed over 24 hours in advance of market activity. With the exception of modifying the timing of sentiment in equation (4), I follow the same
estimation procedure used to develop Table V.
Table VIII displays the robustness check for predicting the SMB factor with
lags two through six of the pessimism measures. The qualitative results from
Table V remain valid in Table VIII, suggesting that the forecasting ability of

negative sentiment for SMB returns persists beyond one day’s worth of trading
activity. Each of the three measures of pessimism strongly predicts SMB returns
(p-values of 0.014, 0.005, and 0.005). The sums of the five coefficients are all
significantly negative from both a statistical perspective (p -values < 0.002) and
an economic perspective (roughly 7 basis points). This evidence demonstrates
that the enduring and large effect of negative sentiment on the SMB factor is
robust to changes in the timing of the return window.
From the similarities between Tables II and VI, Tables IV and VII, and Tables
V and VIII, it appears that the market response to pessimism is dispersed
throughout the following trading week. It is likely that much of the immediate
response to true information contained in the column has already occurred even
before the column has been written. This result is consistent with the stated
practice of the WSJ “Abreast of the Market” columnist, who claims that the
column is written before the end of the prior trading day.
There are reasons to suspect the effect of negative sentiment is stronger
during particular time periods. For example, many economists and practitioners suggest that market valuations during the bull market of the 1990s were
affected by “irrationally exuberant” traders. Under this hypothesis, the sentiment measures examined in this study should exert a larger impact during
the second half of the sample. To investigate this possibility, I split the sample
into two equal-sized subperiods: 1984 to 1991, and 1992 to 1999. For each time
period and each sentiment measure, I repeat the estimation of VAR equation
(1), which predicts Dow Jones returns using negative sentiment and various
control variables.
Table IX reveals that negative sentiment predicts immediate negative returns and gradual reversals during the 1990s, but has a somewhat different
effect during the earlier time period. In fact, the joint hypothesis that sentiment
does not predict returns during the 1984–1991 period can only be rejected for
two of the three measures at the 10% significance level. By contrast, during the
1992–1999 period, the magnitudes of the initial negative impact of sentiment
and subsequent return reversal are economically large and strongly statistically significant. These estimates for the 1990s are so large relative to those for
the 1980s that they appear to dominate the full sample results.
Although the impact of sentiment in the two time periods looks quite different
on the surface, there are some interesting similarities. The average impact of
negative sentiment on three-day cumulative returns is −3.3 basis points in the
earlier period and −7.4 basis points in the later period.19 The average impact of
negative sentiment on day four and five cumulative returns is 7.8 basis points
in the early period and 6.8 basis points in the later period. In other words,
both periods show qualitatively similar 3-day declines and 2-day reversals. I
conclude that sentiment has a quantitatively larger and more immediate impact
in the 1990s, but I cannot rule out the hypothesis that sentiment has a similar
qualitative impact in the earlier time period.

This is an equal-weighted average over the three sentiment measures of the sum of the first
three coefficients in Table IX.

Predicting Dow Jones Returns Using Negative Sentiment
The table data come from CRSP, NYSE, and the General Inquirer program. This table shows OLS
estimates of the coefficient γ 1 in equation (1). Each coefficient measures the impact of a onestandard deviation increase in negative investor sentiment on returns in basis points (one basis
point equals a daily return of 0.01%). Each regression is based on 3,709 observations from January
1, 1984 to September 17, 1999. I use Newey and West (1987) standard errors that are robust to
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation up to five lags. Bold denotes significance at the 5% level;

Thus far, I rely exclusively on parametric estimates of the effect of the media
factors. Using a semiparametric approach to forecasting Dow Jones returns, I
can assess whether there are any asymmetries or nonlinearities in the relationship between the pessimism media factor and stock returns. The semiparametric procedure consists of a parametric and a nonparametric stage. First, I estimate equation (1), omitting only the lags of the negative sentiment measures
from the linear regression, to obtain an estimate of the unexplained (residual)
daily Dow Jones return.20 Second, I form a nonparametric estimate of the effect of negative sentiment on this residual Dow Jones return. I use a standard
locally weighted regression or lowess method to derive the nonparametric estimates. I repeat this procedure for all three measures of negative sentiment,
that is, the pessimism media factor, the Negative words category, and the Weak
words category.
The lowess procedure runs a local regression in the neighborhood of each
data point, repeatedly estimating the effect of negative sentiment on Dow Jones
returns. Under the assumption that the conditional expectation of Dow Jones
returns on sentiment is a continuous and differentiable function, this procedure
combines the point estimates in a smooth conditional expectation function. I

The control variables in the first-stage linear regression are the same as in equation (1).

application of the General Inquirer program to the Wall Street Journal column from January 2,
1984 to September 17, 1999. The Dow Jones residuals come from the regression depicted in equation
(1). The three measures of negative sentiment are calculated using the factor analysis procedure
described in Section III. In the original unsmoothed data, there are 3,709 observations on daily
residual Dow Jones returns and negative sentiment. Each smoothed data point represents the
fitted value from a locally weighted least squares regression of residual Dow Jones returns on
negative sentiment. In each local regression, I apply local weightings from the standard tricube
weighting function to only neighboring values of negative sentiment. The neighborhood for each
data point is centered around the data point and includes one-half of the sample.

use a smoothing bandwidth equal to half the sample to generate the function
shown in Figure 2. In each local regression, I use the standard tricube weighting
function from Cleveland (1979) to weigh data points from nearby values of
sentiment.
Figure 2 displays the results from the three locally weighted regressions for
the three measures of negative sentiment. The nonparametric estimates of the
effect of negative sentiment on Dow Jones returns are broadly consistent with
the qualitative results from the linear parametric structure imposed in the
VAR equations. With the possible exception of a short interval near the vertical
axis, the conditional expectation of returns on the Dow monotonically decreases
as negative sentiment increases. This remains true for all three measures of
sentiment.
The effect of negative sentiment on the Dow appears to be strongest near
the extreme values of returns and sentiment. To assess whether the estimated
relationship between these variables is a statistical f luke driven by outliers,

1162

I replicate the results using independent and dependent variables that are
winsorized at the 1% level. Neither the parametric nor the nonparametric
estimates of the effect of negative sentiment on returns change substantially
as a consequence of the winsorizing process.
Figure 2 shows that the Dow Jones index returns roughly 25 basis points
more on the days in which negative sentiment is very low (bottom 5%) as compared to the days in which negative sentiment is very high (top 5%). The effect of changes in sentiment near the middle of the sentiment distribution is
much smaller—the change in expected returns between −1 and +1 standardized sentiment is only about five basis points. Overall, the qualitative shape and
quantitative estimates of the sentiment effect are very similar for all three measures of sentiment. In further robustness tests not reported here, I find that
the semiparametric results in Figure 2 become slightly stronger, but remain
qualitatively similar, when I eliminate the control variables in the first-stage
parametric regression.
The statistical results in this section show that sentiment plays a significant
role in forecasting temporary market-wide declines in valuation. Sentiment predicts especially large and persistent declines in the returns of small stocks, suggesting sentiment measures individual traders’ views. Sentiment has a much
larger and more sudden impact on returns during the 1990s, suggesting sentiment affected valuations more during this time period. In summary, the tests
here identify return and volume patterns consistent with the hypothesis that
the three variables selected by a factor analysis of words in the WSJ are valid
sentiment indicators.
C. The Economic Importance of the Results
Table II (VI) shows that a one-standard deviation increase in pessimism in
the WSJ column predicts a decrease in Dow Jones returns equal to 8.1 (6.2)
basis points over the next day. Comparisons to other daily returns suggest
that the economic magnitude of the pessimism effect is large. For example,
the average daily return on the Dow Jones over the sample period is 6.3 basis
points, which would be completely offset by a one-standard deviation increase in
pessimism.
The explanatory power of the sentiment measures for forecasting returns
is also quite large relative to other standard variables. The five lags of the
pessimism factor explain just 1.52% of the residual variation in Dow Jones
returns, which may seem small because the magnitude of daily variation in the
Dow Jones index is very large relative to the average daily return on the Dow.
However, the other economic control variables used in this study such as five
lags of Dow returns, five lags of volume, and five time period dummies explain
only 0.16%, 0.30%, and 0.17%, respectively.21
21
The five lags of volatility explain 3.29% of variation in Dow returns, but this is almost attributable to extreme negative returns. Winsorizing the most extreme 1% of returns reduces the
explanatory power of volatility to far less than that of media pessimism.

The success of pessimism in forecasting returns suggests that investors who
read the Dow Jones Newswires can devise profitable trading strategies based
on daily variation in pessimism. For example, a straightforward computer
program, similar to the one written to collect and analyze the data in this paper, could automatically process the electronic text of the Dow Jones Newswires
“Abreast of the Market” column immediately after the column is released on
the newswires. The program could calculate the daily value of pessimism and
use predetermined coefficients, derived from predictability regressions just like
those presented above, to forecast future returns. Depending on whether this
forecast is positive or negative, the media-based trading strategy would go long
or short on the Dow Jones index.
Rather than attempt to construct the optimal real-world trading strategy
based on negative sentiment, I adopt a basic hypothetical trading strategy as a
benchmark. I use the Negative words category as a proxy for negative sentiment
in the trading strategy to minimize the computational burden on the trader.
This category also seems to be the most intuitive measure of negative investor
sentiment. To ensure that the success of the trading strategy is not driven
by bid-ask bounce or day-of-the-week effects, I compute the residual from a
regression of Negative words demeaned by day-of-the-week on five lags of past
Dow Jones returns.22
Following days in which Negative words are in the bottom third of the prior
year’s Negative word distribution, I borrow at the riskless rate to purchase
all the stocks in the Dow Jones index and sell them back one day later. One
day after Negative words are in the top third of the prior year’s Negative word
distribution, I borrow all the stocks in the Dow Jones index, receiving the riskless rate, and buy them back one day later.23 Although this strategy is neither
perfectly optimal nor perfectly realistic, it represents a useful benchmark for
evaluating the potential of media content to predict returns.
The strategy buys the index 1,281 times and sells the index 1,254 times in the
3,700+ trading days between 1985 and 1999. The average daily return of this
zero-cost strategy is 4.4 basis points, which is slightly larger than the average
daily excess return on the Dow Jones itself, and statistically significant at the
99% level. The annualized return of the pessimism-based strategy is 7.3%,
which seems economically important.24
To assess the robustness and riskiness of this strategy, I examine its performance in yearly subsamples. For each of the 15 years, I calculate an estimate
22
To avoid any hindsight bias, I use the prior year’s day-of-the-week means to compute the
means. This implies that I cannot use the first year of my news sample, 1984, in the trading
strategy.
23
These two strategies are equivalent to going long and short on a Dow Jones futures contract.
Ignoring margin and capital requirements, both strategies are zero-cost strategies.
24
The trading strategy has positive returns of 7.1 and 1.7 basis points on days in which the
hypothetical strategy buys and sells the index, respectively. Because the former strategy has a
beta of 1 and the latter has a beta of −1, the return difference is consistent with the existence of
a daily market risk premium of roughly 2.7 basis points or an annualized risk premium of about
10%, which is a reasonable estimate in light of the high returns during the 1990s.

1164

The Journal of Finance

of expected trading returns equal to the difference in the arithmetic means
of the Dow returns on the buy and sell days. In 12 of the 15 years, the estimated expected returns are positive, which is unlikely to occur by chance
(p-value = 0.018).25 This consistent performance suggests the pessimism-based
trading strategy is robust and relatively safe.
An important disclaimer renders this hypothetical trading strategy less attractive than it first appears. First, any daily trading strategy will incur transaction costs, price impact costs, and capital gains taxes that may be prohibitive.
Typical trading commissions on the Dow Jones index futures contracts listed on
the Chicago Board of Trade are less than one basis point for a round trip transaction.26 However, commissions do not include the price impact of trades or
capital gains taxes. Depending on the size of the transaction, costs attributable
to bid-ask spreads and finite market depth may exceed 4.4 basis points per
trade—the cutoff value for eliminating the profitability of a pessimism-based
trading strategy.27 A formal investigation of the price impact and short-run
capital gains taxes incurred by these trading strategies lies beyond the scope
of this paper.
Although the statistical results above establish a relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns, the nature of this relationship requires further study before investors can implement reliable news-based trading strategies. The next section addresses this concern.
IV. Interpreting the Results
To assess whether the pessimism factor relates to investor sentiment, I attempt to identify the GI categories most closely related to pessimism. These
tests may suggest a specific behavioral mechanism underlying the regression results above.28 A decomposition of the pessimism factor into its constituents may suggest candidates for direct measures of investor sentiment
that could be tested in future research. In this spirit, I test whether the GI categories underlying pessimism predict similar patterns in returns and volume.
25
The strategy has negative expected returns in the years 1986, 1988, and 1990, when Dow
Jones returned 23%, 12%, and −4%, respectively, suggesting the strategy has very little systematic
risk. In fact, the daily correlation between the strategies’ returns and the market is significantly
negative.
26
For example, as of September 13, 2004, the discount brokerage TradeStation Securities
charged only $5 per round-trip transaction in Dow Jones futures valued at over $50,000 per
contract.
27
Typically, the spread at the inside quote for the Dow Jones E-mini contract is about one basis
point, but a large trade of contracts having a $10,000,000 notional value would incur a spread of
five basis points or more. Moreover, this particular Dow Jones futures contract did not exist until
relatively recently. Instruments available to traders in the past may have had larger spreads.
28
The theories of DeLong et al. (1990) and Campbell et al. (1993), which are consistent with
the results above, do not explicitly model the psychology behind sentiment. DeLong et al. (1990a)
assumes that noise traders’ beliefs change randomly from period to period without specifying why.
Similarly, Campbell et al. (1993) simply assumes the existence of shocks to investors’ discount
factors that drive liquidity demand.

Tables II–IX examine the two categories, Negative and Weak, that have the
highest correlations with pessimism and the highest weightings in the linear
combination of categories that comprises pessimism.29
A. Do the Factors Relate to Investor Sentiment?
The Negative and Weak word categories are easier to interpret than the factor
itself, which consists of a linear combination of all 77 GI categories. Because
these two categories capture most of the variation in the pessimism factor, it
seems likely that they convey the same semantic ideas to readers of the column
and, therefore, exhibit the same relationship to stock market activity.
The results reported in Tables II–VIII support this interpretation of the pessimism factor. First and foremost, in both sets of return regressions, Negative
and Weak words forecast the same temporary decline and reversal predicted by
the pessimism factor. This remains true whether or not the regressions use dependent variables that include after-hours and opening-half-hour returns and
volume. Although the magnitude of the coefficients diminishes slightly in some
specifications, all results remain significant at the 5% level.
Second, changes in Negative words and changes in Weak words robustly forecast increases in volume. The absolute values of Negative and Weak words are
slightly stronger predictors of increases in the next day’s volume, both in magnitude and significance, than pessimism. Third, similar to the pessimism factor,
Negative and Weak words tend to follow market declines. This effect is statistically and economically comparable to the effect of the market on pessimism.
Taken as a whole, these tests suggest that the GI categories Negative and
Weak that underlie the pessimism factor are reasonable proxies for the factor
in terms of their ability to forecast market activity. This finding demonstrates
that the results are not only robust, but also easily interpretable in terms of
well-established psychological variables.30
In unreported tests, I examine whether the pessimism media factor and the
underlying GI category variables are proxies for decreases in volatility. The risk
premium hypothesis is that investors require lower returns on the Dow Jones
on days in which there are many Negative words in the WSJ column because
holding the Dow Jones stocks is less risky on these days.
Unfortunately, as Ghysels, Santa-Clara, and Valkanov (2004) note, tests of
the risk-return trade-off over short samples may not have sufficient power to
identify the true relationship. Indeed, using my sample of 16 years (which is
roughly five times shorter than theirs), I am unable to detect any significant
change in daily expected returns on the Dow in response to changes in the
29
It is not a foregone conclusion that the two categories most highly correlated with pessimism
would also receive the highest weightings in the linear combination of categories that comprises
pessimism.
30
The pessimism factor, Negative words, and Weak words are all significantly negatively correlated with the measures of (positive) investor sentiment proposed by Whaley (2000) and Baker and
Wurgler (2005). Neither the Whaley (2000) nor the Baker and Wurgler (2005) sentiment measure
subsumes the explanatory power of the sentiment measures presented here.

1166

The Journal of Finance

volatility of the Dow, calling the risk-return relationship into question for these
variables in this sample. Notwithstanding such measurement concerns, I test
the risk premium hypothesis and find that the conditional volatility of the Dow
appears to be higher (not lower) when the pessimism factor is high. Thus, even
if there is a meaningful risk-return trade-off in daily Dow Jones returns, it does
not appear that media pessimism contributes to lower expected future returns
through its effects on conditional volatility.
V. Conclusions
This study systematically explores the interactions between media content
and stock market activity. I construct a straightforward measure of media content that appears to correspond to either negative investor sentiment or risk
aversion. Pessimistic media content variables forecast patterns of market activity that are consistent with the DeLong et al. (1990a) and Campbell et al.
(1993) models of noise and liquidity traders. High values of media pessimism
induce downward pressure on market prices; unusually high or low values of
pessimism lead to temporarily high market trading volume. Furthermore, the
price impact of pessimism appears especially large and slow to reverse itself in
small stocks. This is consistent with sentiment theories under the assumption
that media content is linked to the behavior of individual investors, who own a
disproportionate fraction of small stocks.
By contrast, the hypothesis that pessimism represents negative fundamental
information not yet incorporated into prices receives very little support from
the data. The changes in market returns that follow pessimistic media content
are dispersed throughout the trading day, rather than concentrated after the
release of information. Moreover, the negative returns following negative sentiment are reversed over the next few days of market activity, casting further
doubt on an information interpretation of media content.
Pessimism, which predicts temporary decreases in returns, does not appear
to be related to decreases in risk measures. In fact, pessimism weakly predicts
increases in market volatility. In summary, the results are inconsistent with
theories that view media content as either a proxy for new information about
fundamentals, a proxy for market volatility, or an irrelevant noisy variable.
The fact that different measures of negative sentiment, that is, the pessimism
factor, Negative words, and Weak words, bear the same relationship to future
market activity is reassuring in two ways. First, because the raw GI word
categories were designed by psychologists, they have natural interpretations
as measures of negative sentiment. Second, reporting tests based on multiple
measures of sentiment mitigates the potential for data mining.
It is possible to construct a hypothetical zero-cost trading strategy using
Negative words that yields nontrivial excess returns (7.3% per year) with little risk. However, implementing this strategy would require frequent portfolio turnover, leading to significant costs from commissions, bid-ask spreads,
limited market depth, and capital gains taxes. It is unclear whether, after accounting for these costs, a sentiment-based trading strategy would

remain profitable. Indeed, these limits to high-frequency arbitrage may prevent markets from responding efficiently to the information embedded in media
content.
Appendix: Content Analysis of News Articles
Some examples of the 77 categories in this dictionary include: Negative, 2,291
words pertaining to negative events; Strong, 1,902 words implying strength;
Passive, 911 words implying a passive orientation; Pleasure, 168 words indicating enjoyment of a feeling; Arousal, 166 words indicating excitation; Economic,
510 words of an economic, commercial or business orientation; and IAV, 1,947
verbs giving an interpretive explanation of an action.
The GI draws nuanced distinctions between words with identical appearances but different meanings. For example, the word “account” has eight different entries in the Harvard dictionary, which map into eight different category
classifications. By examining the context of the word in the WSJ column, the
GI can recognize one preposition form, five noun forms, one verb form, and one
adverb form of the word “account.” When “account” means “because” as in the
phrase “on account of,” the GI categorizes it as Causal, which includes words
denoting presumption that occurrence of one phenomenon is necessarily preceded, accompanied, or followed by the occurrence of another. When “account”
means “explain” as in the phrase “to account for,” the GI places “account” in
the following categories: Active, words with an active orientation; Solve, words
associated with the mental process of problem solving; and IAV, interpretive
verbs.
Unfortunately, the GI is a pure word count program, so it does not categorize combinations of words that often possess different meanings from the
constituent words. As an example of this fault, consider the sentences: “No, the
economy is not strong” and “It is not that the economy is not strong.” The GI
understands and categorizes all of the important words in both sentences, but
pure category counts would suggest that these sentences have identical meanings. In fact, the sentences have opposite meanings. Even though semantic and
stylistic noise partially obscure interpretations of the Wall Street Journal column based on the GI, the GI may still provide interesting raw data that is
correlated with important semantic components of the column.
